    "wikipedia_summary": "Before Sunset is a 2004 American romantic drama film directed by Richard Linklater, who co-wrote the screenplay with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, from a story by Linklater and Kim Krizan. The sequel to Before Sunrise (1995) and the second installment in the Before trilogy, Before Sunset follows Jesse (Hawke) and C\u00e9line (Delpy) as they reunite nine years later in Paris.\nLinklater, Krizan, Hawke, and Delpy began developing a larger budget sequel after the release of Before Sunrise, but failed to secure funding. After a period of independent work, notably inspired by Hawke's divorce from Uma Thurman, the writers came together in 2003 and incorporated elements of their screenplays, as well as scenes written during development of Before Sunrise, to create the film's screenplay. Principal photography took place entirely in Paris, and the film is considered to take place in real time. Delpy also contributed original music to the film's soundtrack.\nBefore Sunset premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 10, 2004, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 2, 2004. It grossed $15 million against a $2.7 million production budget and received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Linklater's direction, the performances and chemistry of its leads, and its screenplay. It received numerous accolades, being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and appeared on many publications' lists of the best films of the year, some even calling it one of the best of the decade.

Linklater considered a version to be filmed in four locations and with a much larger budget. When his proposal did not secure funding, he scaled back the concept of the movie. In a 2010 interview, Hawke said that the four had worked on several potential scripts over the years. As time passed and they did not secure funding, they adapted elements of the earlier scripts for <i>Before Sunrise</i> in their final draft of <i>Before Sunset.</i></p><p>Linklater described the process of completing the final version of the film as:\n</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>We sat in a room and worked together in about a two- or three-day period, worked out a very detailed outline of the whole film in this sort of real-time environment. And then, over the next year or so, we just started e-mailing each other and faxing. I was sort of a conduit \u2013 they would send me monologues and dialogues and scenes and ideas, and I was editing, compiling and writing. And that's how we came up with a script.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hawke said, \"It's not like anybody was begging us to make a second film. We obviously did it because we wanted to.\"</p><p>The movie was filmed entirely on location in Paris. It opens inside the Shakespeare and Company bookstore on the Left Bank. Other locations include their walking through the Marais district of the 4th arrondissement, Le Pure Caf\u00e9 in the 11th arrondissement, the Promenade Plant\u00e9e park in the 12th arrondissement, on board a <i>bateau mouche</i> from Quai de la Tournelle to Quai Henri IV, the interior of a taxi, and finally \"C\u00e9line's apartment.\" Described in the film as located at 10 rue des Petites-\u00c9curies, it was filmed in Cour de l'\u00c9toile d'Or off rue du Faubourg St-Antoine.\n</p><p>The movie was filmed in 15 days, on a budget of about US$2\u20132.7 million. The film is noted for its use of the Steadicam for tracking shots and its use of long takes; the longest of the Steadicam takes lasts about 11 minutes. As the summer was one of the hottest on record, the cast and crew suffered along with the city residents, as temperatures exceeded 100 degrees F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) for most of the production.\n</p><p>The film is notable for essentially taking place in real time, i.e. the time elapsed in the story is the run time of the film. In the fast-changing temperate Paris climate, this created challenges for the cinematographer Lee Daniel to match the color and intensity of the skies and ambient light from scene to scene. The scenes were mostly shot in sequence, as they were still developing the screenplay. Producer Anne Walker-McBay worked with less time and less money than she had on <i>Before Sunrise</i>, but still brought the film in on time and on budget. The sequel was released nine years after <i>Before Sunrise</i>, the same amount of time that has lapsed in the plot since the events of the first film.\n</p><p>The film was released in the wake of Hawke's divorce from Uma Thurman. Some commentators drew parallels between Hawke's personal life and the character of Jesse in the film. Additional comment has noted that both Hawke and Delpy incorporated elements of their own lives into the screenplay. Delpy wrote two of the songs featured in the film, and a third by her was included in the closing credits and movie soundtrack.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Release</h2>\n<p><i>Before Sunset</i> premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2004, and received a limited release in the United States on July 2, 2004.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Box office</h3>\n<p>In its opening weekend, the film grossed $219,425 in 20 theaters in the United States, averaging $10,971 per theater. During its entire theatrical run, the film grossed $5.8 million in the United States and nearly $16 million worldwide.</p>\n\n<h3>Critical reception</h3>\n<p>On Rotten Tomatoes <i>Before Sunset</i> holds an approval rating of 94% based on 177 reviews, with an average rating of 8.30/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"Filled with engaging dialogue, <i>Before Sunset</i> is a witty, poignant romance, with natural chemistry between Hawke and Delpy.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 91 out of 100 based on 39 reviews from mainstream publications, indicating \"universal acclaim\". The film appeared on 28 critics' top 10 lists of the best films of 2004, and took the 27th spot on Metacritic's list of The Best-Reviewed Movies of the Decade (2000\u201309).</p><p>In comparing this film to its predecessor, American film critic Roger Ebert wrote, \"<i>Before Sunrise</i> was a remarkable celebration of the fascination of good dialogue. But <i>Before Sunset</i> is better, perhaps because the characters are older and wiser, perhaps because they have more to lose (or win), and perhaps because Hawke and Delpy wrote the dialogue themselves.\" In her review for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, Manohla Dargis lauded the film as a \"deeper, truer work of art than the first,\" and praised director Linklater for making a film that \"keeps faith with American cinema at its finest.\"</p><p>Reviewing the acting, Peter Travers of <i>Rolling Stone</i> observed, \"Hawke and Delpy find nuance, art and eroticism in words, spoken and unspoken. The actors shine.\" Philip French of <i>The Observer</i> wrote,\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r996844942\"><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Both Hawke and Delpy are excellent and their performances have real depth. This time, too, they're doing more than appearing as fictional creations in a <i>Richard Linklater</i> film. They now share the writing credit with him and are clearly putting much of their experiences of the past decade into characters they have possessed and been possessed by.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On the merits of the script, A. O. Scott of <i>The New York Times</i> noted, it was \"sometimes maddening,\" but \"also enthralling, precisely because of its casual disregard for the usual imperatives of screenwriting.\" He elaborated,\n</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r996844942\"><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Can't they just say what they mean? Can you? Language, after all, is not just about points and meanings. It is a medium of communication, yes, but also of avoidance, misdirection, self-protection and plain confusion, all of which are among the themes of this movie, which captures a deep truth seldom acknowledged on screen or in books.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the United Kingdom, the film was ranked the 110th-greatest movie of all time by a 2008 <i>Empire</i> poll. In 2010, the critics at <i>The Guardian</i> placed <i>Before Sunrise/Before Sunset</i> at number 3 in their list of the best romantic films of all time, and called the ending of <i>Before Sunset</i> \"one of the most tantalising and ingenious endings in all cinema.\"</p>\n<dl><dt>Top 10 lists</dt></dl><p>As noted by Metacritic, the film appeared on the following critics' top 10 lists of 2004.</p>\n\n<h3>Accolades</h3>\n<dl><dt>Awards</dt></dl><ul><li>2004 Boston Society of Film Critics Award \u2013 Best Film (2nd Place)</li></ul><dl><dt>Nominations</dt></dl><ul><li>2004 77th Academy Awards \u2013 Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay) for Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy, Ethan Hawke and Kim Krizan</li>\n<li>2004 Independent Spirit Award \u2013 Best Screenplay for Richard Linklater, July Delpy and Ethan Hawke</li>\n<li>2005 Writers Guild of America Award \u2013 Best Adapted Screenplay for Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy, Ethan Hawke and Kim Krizan</li>\n<li>2004 Berlin International Film Festival \u2013 Golden Bear</li>\n<li>2004 Gotham Awards \u2013 Best Film</li></ul><p>In a 2016 BBC poll of 177 critics worldwide, <i>Before Sunset</i> was voted the 73rd best film since 2000.
