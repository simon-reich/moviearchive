It extensively uses the fourth wall device, but repeatedly broken and re-erected.

The information was not recorded compressed to tape as usual, but uncompressed onto a hard disk which could hold 100 minutes which was carried behind the cameraman as he traveled from room to room, scene to scene. According to <i>In One Breath: Alexander Sokurov's Russian Ark</i>, the documentary on the making of the film, four attempts were made. The first failed at the five-minute mark. After two more failed attempts, they were left with only enough battery power for one final take. The four hours of daylight available were also nearly gone. Fortunately, the final take was a success and the film was completed at 90 minutes. Tilman B\u00fcttner, the director of photography and Steadicam operator, executed the shot on 23 December 2001.\n</p><p>In a 2002 interview, B\u00fcttner said that film sound was recorded separately. \"Every time I did the take, or someone else made a mistake, I would curse, and that would have gotten in, so we did the sound later.\" Lighting directors of photography on the film were Bernd Fischer and Anatoli Radionov. The director later rejected B\u00fcttner's nomination for a European Film Academy award, believing that only the whole film should gain an award.</p>\n\n<h2>Post-production</h2>\n<p>In post-production the uncompressed HD 87-minute one-shot could be reworked in detail: besides many object removals (mainly cables and other film equipment), compositings (e.g. additional snow or fog), stabilisations, selective colour-corrections and digitally added focus changes, the whole film was continuously and dynamically reframed (resized) and for certain moments even time-warped (slowed down and sped up). This work took several weeks and was mainly executed by editor Patrick Wilfert under supervision of lead editor Sergei Ivanov on Discreet Logic's Inferno system. Avoiding any playouts and using framestore to framestore transfers only, the picture was left uncompressed, before being reprinted onto filmstock for theatrical distribution.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>The narrator's guide, \"the European\", is based on the book by the French aristocrat Marquis de Custine, who visited Russia in 1839 and wrote <i>La Russie en 1839</i>, in which he depicted Russia in extremely unflattering terms. A few biographical elements from Custine's life are shown in the film. Like the European, the Marquis' mother was friends with the Italian sculptor Canova and he himself was very religious. Custine's book mocks Russian civilization as a thin veneer of Europe on an Asiatic soul. For Custine, Europe was \"civilization\" while Asia was \"barbarism\", and his placing of Russia as a part of Asia rather than Europe was meant to deny that Russians had any sort of civilization worthy of the name. Echoing this sentiment, the film's European comments that Russia is a theater and that the people he meets are actors. The Marquis's family fortune came from a porcelain works, hence the European's interest in the S\u00e8vres porcelain waiting for the diplomatic reception. At the end of the film, which depicts the last imperial ball in 1913, the European appears to accept Russia as a European nation.\n</p><p><i>In One Breath</i>, a documentary about the making of <i>Russian Ark</i>, written and directed by Knut Elstermann, gives more insight into the single long shot tracking techniques and formidable organization behind the making of the film.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n<h3>Box office</h3>\n<p>The film was not a huge commercial success, though as an arthouse film it performed strongly in many territories. These include the UK, Japan, Korea, Argentina, and especially the US, where the film remains one of the most successful of both German and Russian movies of recent decades.</p><p><i>Russian Ark</i> is a German-Russian co-production. The film grossed $3,048,997 in the United States and Canada, with $5,641,171 internationally, for a worldwide total of $8,690,168.</p>\n\n<h3>Critical response</h3>\n<p><i>Russian Ark</i> received high critical acclaim.
