As a vampire, she is able to roam the streets at night without being concerned for her safety, subverting the implications of the film's title. She is the perpetrator, not the victim, and possesses agency and power that would not be typically reserved for her in an environment such as Bad City. In this way, the film has feminist leanings.\n</p><p>Rockabilly, a gender-bending, minor background character who exists on the fringe of Bad City throughout the duration of the movie, acts as a silent observer to the events around them. Director Amirpour states, \"If there's one political thing [in the film], it's not the chador, it's Rockabilly, because it's not okay to be gay in Iran.\"</p>\n\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>An early short film with the same title from Amirpour screened at festivals and won Best Short Film at the Noor Iranian Film Festival.</p><p>An Indiegogo campaign was launched in July 2012 to fund the feature-length version of the film. On August 27, 2012, the campaign's goal of $55,000 was surpassed. The project ended up with a total sum of $56,903 raised by 290 backers.</p><p><i>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</i> was shot over the course of twenty-four days, in the town of Taft in Kern County in Southern California. This allowed Amirpour to not be constrained by the restrictions of filming in Iran, which include having to obtain a filming permit and facing content censorship, such as the prohibition of almost all depictions of physical romantic love.</p><p>The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2014.</p><p>In an interview with <i>MovieMaker</i>, Amirpour spoke regarding her relationship with filmmaking:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>People ask me, \"Why did you make <i>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</i>?\" My answer is that I was lonely\u2014that's why. But taking that a step further, the truth is that I make films to make friends and find real intimacy; a connection with others based on something that's meaningful to me. The people who make these films with you, your cast and crew\u2014it's like they're on a vision quest with you. That is an incomparable experience. And then when the film is done and out there, the people who are attracted to your film\u2014the audiences, festivals that embrace it, other filmmakers, artists, the critics who like what you do\u2014those are my friends. And I don't expect to be friends with everyone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Amirpour is a lifelong skater, and was a stand-in for the skateboarding sequences present in the film.</p>\n\n<h2>Style</h2>\n<p>The film is directed and imagined by Amirpour with cinematography by Lyle Vincent. Its style is clearly inspired by Spaghetti Westerns like those of Sergio Leone, featuring a mysterious, lone, antihero with a vigilante streak. However, the genre is reimagined with a female lead, and is a hybrid spaghetti Western-vampire film. As a vampire film it serves as an homage to its legacy of predecessors especially the 1922 German Expressionist film <i>Nosferatu</i>. Echoes of the film are seen in the choice of shooting in black-and-white, the use of shadows, and the minimal dialogue. The film's dialogue is entirely in Persian, and the film blends elements of Iranian culture with the spaghetti Western-vampire imagery described above.</p><p>The film was shot digitally with anamorphic lenses, which Amirpour and Vincent selected in an effort to emphasize the bleak, otherworldly atmosphere of the film.</p><p>Amirpour has stated that graphic novels are a major source of inspiration for her. The visual language of the film is not unlike that of a comic book, with its \"high-contrast monochrome aesthetic\". Additionally, Bad City, the fictional location in which the film is set, may perhaps be a nod to Frank Miller's <i>Sin City</i>.</p><p>Amirpour has said that she had her actors watch <i>Nosferatu</i> and many spaghetti Westerns in preparation for their roles.</p><p>She has also said that \"every piece of the story, every character, every costume, every bit of music\" is something that she \"love[s] to the point of obsession.\"</p>\n\n<h2>Soundtrack</h2>\n<p>A limited-edition vinyl pressing of the soundtrack, and accompanying album art, was released by Death Waltz Records in January 2014.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n<p>The film received positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 96% based on 135 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10.
