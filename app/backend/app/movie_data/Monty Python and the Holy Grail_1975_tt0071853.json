Half of the material was set in the Middle Ages and half was set in the present day. The group decided to focus on the Middle Ages, focusing on the legend of the Holy Grail. By the fourth or fifth draft, the story was complete, and the cast joked that the fact that the Grail was never retrieved would be \"a big let-down ... a great anti-climax\". Graham Chapman said a challenge was incorporating scenes that did not fit the Holy Grail motif.</p><p>Neither Terry Gilliam nor Terry Jones had directed a film before, and described it as a learning experience in which they would learn to make a film by making an entire full-length film. The cast humorously described the novice directing style as employing the level of mutual disrespect always found in Monty Python's work.</p><p>A 2021 tweet by Eric Idle revealed that the film was financed by eight investors: Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson, <i>Holy Grail'</i>s co-producer Michael White, Heartaches (a cricket team founded by lyricist Tim Rice), and three record companies including Charisma Records, the record label that released Python's early comedy albums. Idle and Terry Gilliam had previously mentioned that Elton John also contributed to the financing of the film. The investors contributed the entire original budget of \u00a3175,350 (about $410,000 in 1974) and also received a percentage of the proceeds from the 2005 musical <i>Spamalot</i>.</p><p>According to Gilliam, the Pythons turned to rock stars like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin for finance as the studios refused to fund the film and rock stars saw it as \"a good tax write-off\" because the top rate of UK income tax was \"as high as 90%\" at the time.</p>\n\n<h3>Filming</h3>\n<p><i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i> was mostly shot on location in Scotland, particularly around Doune Castle, Glen Coe, and the privately owned Castle Stalker. The many castles seen throughout the film were mainly either Doune Castle shot from different angles or hanging miniatures. There are several exceptions to this: the very first exterior shot of a castle at the beginning of the film is Kidwelly Castle in South Wales, and the single exterior shot of the Swamp Castle during \"Tale of Sir Lancelot\" is Bodiam Castle in East Sussex; all subsequent shots of the exterior and interior of those scenes were filmed at Doune Castle. Production designer Julian Doyle recounted that his crew constructed walls in the forest near Doune. Terry Jones later recalled the crew had selected more castles around Scotland for locations, but during the two weeks prior to principal photography, the Scottish Department of the Environment declined permission for use of the castles in its jurisdiction, for fear of damage.</p><p>At the start of \"The Tale of Sir Robin\", there is a slow camera zoom in on rocky scenery (that in the voice-over is described as \"the dark forest of Ewing\"). This is actually a still photograph of the gorge at Mount Buffalo National Park in Victoria, Australia. Doyle stated in 2000 during an interview with <i>Hotdog</i> magazine that it was a still image filmed with candles underneath the frame (to give a heat haze). This was a low-cost method of achieving a convincing location effect.\n</p><p>On the DVD audio commentary, Cleese described challenges shooting and editing Castle Anthrax in \"The Tale of Sir Galahad\", with what he felt the most comedic take being unused because an anachronistic coat was visible in it. Castle Anthrax was also shot in one part of Doune, where costume designer Hazel Pethig advised against nudity, dressing the girls in shifts.</p><p>The scene in which the knights fight the Rabbit of Caerbannog was filmed at Tomnadashan mine. A real white rabbit was used, switched with puppets for its killings. The bite effects were done with special puppetry by both Gilliam and SFX technician John Horton. According to Gilliam, the rabbit was covered with red liquid to simulate blood, though its owner did not want the animal dirty and was kept unaware. The liquid was difficult to remove from the fur. Gilliam also stated that he thought, in hindsight, the crew could have just purchased their own rabbit instead. Regardless, the rabbit itself was unharmed. \n</p><p>As chronicled in <i>The Life of Python</i>, <i>The First 20 Years of Monty Python</i>, and <i>The Pythons' Autobiography</i>, Chapman suffered from acrophobia, trembling and bouts of forgetfulness during filming due to his alcoholism, prompting him to refrain from drinking while the production continued in order to remain \"on an even keel\". Nearly three years later, in December 1977, Chapman achieved sobriety.\n</p><p>Originally the knight characters were going to ride real horses, but after it became clear that the film's small budget precluded real horses (except for a lone horse appearing in a couple of scenes), the Pythons decided their characters would mime horse-riding while their porters trotted behind them banging coconut shells together. The joke was derived from the old-fashioned sound effect used by radio shows to convey the sound of hooves clattering. This was later referred to in the German release of the film, which translated the title as <i>Die Ritter der Kokosnu\u00df</i> (<i>The Knights of the Coconut</i>). Similarly, the Hungarian title <i>Gyalog galopp</i> translates to \"Galloping on Foot\".</p><p>The opening credits of the film feature pseudo-Swedish subtitles, which soon turn into an appeal to visit Sweden and see the country's moose. The subtitles are soon stopped and claim that the people responsible have been sacked, but moose references continue throughout the actual credits. The subtitles were written by Michael Palin as a way to \"entertain the 'captive' audience\" at the beginning of the film.</p>\n\n<h2>Soundtrack</h2>\n<p>In addition to several songs written by Python regular Neil Innes, several pieces of music were licensed from De Wolfe Music Library. These include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>\"Wide Horizon\", composed by Pierre Arvay; used during the opening titles.</li>\n<li>\"Ice Floe 9\", composed by Pierre Arvay; used during the opening titles.</li>\n<li>\"Countrywide\", composed by Anthony Mawer; used during the beginning titles after the first titlers are sacked.</li>\n<li>\"Homeward Bound\", composed by Jack Trombey; used as King Arthur's heroic theme.</li>\n<li>\"Crossed Swords\", composed by Dudley Matthew; played during King Arthur's battle with the Black Knight.</li>\n<li>\"The Flying Messenger\", composed by Oliver Armstrong; played during Sir Lancelot's misguided storming of Swamp Castle.</li>\n<li>\"The Promised Land\", composed by Stanley Black; used in the scene where Arthur approaches the castle on the island.</li>\n<li>\"Starlet in the Starlight\", composed by Kenneth Essex; briefly used for Prince Herbert's attempt to express himself in song.</li>\n<li>\"Love Theme\", composed by Peter Knight; also used briefly for Prince Herbert.</li>\n<li>\"Revolt\", composed by Eric Towren; used as the army charges on Castle Aaargh.</li></ul><p>Innes was supposed to write the film's soundtrack in its entirety, but after the team watched the movie with Innes's soundtrack, they decided to go instead with \"canned\" music, music borrowed from existing stock recordings. One problem with Innes's music, apparently, was that they considered it too appropriate, so that, according to Python scholar Darl Larsen, it \"undercut the Pythons' attempt at undercutting the medieval world they were trying to depict\".</p>\n\n<h2>Release</h2>\n<p><i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i> had its theatrical debut in the United Kingdom on 3 April 1975, followed by a United States release on 27 April 1975 at the Century Plaza Cinemas in Los Angeles. It was re-released on 14 October 2015 in the United Kingdom.</p><p>It earned rentals in the US and Canada of $5.17 million.</p><p>The film had its television premiere 25 February 1977 on the <i>CBS Late Movie</i>. Reportedly, the Pythons were displeased to discover a number of edits were done by the network to reduce use of profanity and the showing of blood. The troupe pulled back the rights and thereafter had it broadcast in the United States only on PBS and later other channels such as Comedy Central and IFC, where it runs uncut.</p>\n\n<h3>Box office</h3>\n<p>According to records of the NFFC, as of 31 December 1978 the distributor earned receipts of \u00a32,358,229.</p>\n\n<h3>Home media</h3>\n<p>In Region 1, The Criterion Collection released a LaserDisc version of the film featuring audio commentary from directors Jones and Gilliam.</p><p>In 2001, Columbia Tristar published a two-disc, special-edition DVD. Disc one includes the Jones and Gilliam commentary, a second commentary with Idle, Palin and Cleese, the film's screenplay on a subtitle track and \"Subtitles for People Who Don't Like the Film\"\u2013consisting of lines taken from William Shakespeare's <i>Henry IV, Part 2</i>. Disc two includes <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Lego</i>, a \"brickfilm\" version of the \"Camelot Song\" as sung by Lego minifigures. It was created by Spite Your Face Productions on commission from the Lego Group and Python Pictures. The project was conceived by the original film's respective producer and co-director, John Goldstone and Terry Gilliam. Disc two also includes two scenes from the film's Japanese dub, literally translated back into English through subtitles. \"The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations\", hosted by Palin and Jones, shows places in Scotland used for the setting titled as \"England 932 A.D.\" (as well as the two Pythons purchasing a copy of their own script as a guide). Also included is a who's who page, advertising galleries and sing-alongs. A \"Collector's Edition\" DVD release additionally included a book of the screenplay, a limited-edition film cell/senitype, and limited-edition art cards.</p><p>A 35th-anniversary edition on Blu-ray was released in the US on 6 March 2012. Special features include \"The Holy Book of Days,\" a second-screen experience that can be downloaded as an app on an iOS device and played with the Blu-ray to enhance its viewing, lost animation sequences with a new intro from animator Terry Gilliam, outtakes and extended scenes with Python member and the movie's co-director Terry Jones.</p><p>On the special edition DVD, the studio logos, opening credits and a brief portion of the opening scene of 1961 British Film <i>Dentist on the Job</i> is added to the start of the film. The clip ends with a spluttering, unseen \"projectionist\" realising he has played the wrong film. A \"slide\" then appears urging the audience to wait one moment please while the operator changes reels.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception and legacy</h2>\n<p>Contemporary reviews were mixed. Vincent Canby of <i>The New York Times</i> wrote in a favourable review that the film had \"some low spots,\" but had gags which were \"nonstop, occasionally inspired and should not be divulged, though it's not giving away too much to say that I particularly liked a sequence in which the knights, to gain access to an enemy castle, come up with the idea of building a Trojan rabbit.\" Charles Champlin of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> was also positive, writing that the film, \"like <i>Mad</i> comics, is not certain to please every taste. But its youthful exuberance and its rousing zaniness are hard not to like. As a matter of fact, the sense of fun is dangerously contagious.\" Penelope Gilliatt of <i>The New Yorker</i> called the film \"often recklessly funny and sometimes a matter of comic genius.\"</p><p>Other reviews were less enthusiastic. <i>Variety</i> wrote that the storyline was \"basically an excuse for set pieces, some amusing, others overdone.\" Gene Siskel of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing that he felt \"it contained about 10 very funny moments and 70 minutes of silence. Too many of the jokes took too long to set up, a trait shared by both <i>Blazing Saddles</i> and <i>Young Frankenstein</i>. I guess I prefer Monty Python in chunks, in its original, television revue format.\" Gary Arnold of <i>The Washington Post</i> called the film \"a fitfully amusing spoof of the Arthurian legends\" but \"rather poky\" in tempo, citing the running gag of Swedish subtitles in the opening credits as an example of how the Pythons \"don't know when to let go of any <i>shtik</i>\". Geoff Brown of <i>The Monthly Film Bulletin</i> wrote in a mixed review that \"the team's visual buffooneries and verbal rigamaroles (some good, some bad, but mostly indifferent) are piled on top of each other with no attention to judicious timing or structure, and a form which began as a jaunty assault on the well-made revue sketch and an ingenious misuse of television's fragmented style of presentation, threatens to become as unyielding and unfruitful as the conventions it originally attacked.\"</p>\n<p>The film's reputation grew over time. In 2000, readers of <i>Total Film</i> magazine voted <i>Holy Grail</i> the fifth-greatest comedy film of all time. The next Python film, <i>Life of Brian</i>, was ranked first. A 2006 poll of Channel 4 viewers on the 50 Greatest Comedy Films saw <i>Holy Grail</i> placed in sixth place (with <i>Life of Brian</i> again topping the list). In 2011, an ABC prime-time special, <i>Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time</i>, counted down the best films chosen by fans based on results of a poll conducted by ABC and <i>People</i>. <i>Holy Grail</i> was selected as the second best comedy after <i>Airplane!</i> In 2016, <i>Empire</i> magazine ranked <i>Holy Grail</i> 18th in their list of the 100 best British films (<i>Life of Brian</i> was ranked 2nd), their entry stating, \"Elvis ordered a print of this comedy classic and watched it five times. If it's good enough for the King, it's good enough for you.\"</p><p>In a 2017 interview at Indiana University in Bloomington, John Cleese expressed disappointment with the film's conclusion. \"'The ending annoys me the most'\", he said after a screening of the film on the Indiana campus, adding that \"'It ends the way it does because we couldn't think of any other way'\". However, scripts for the film and notebooks that are among Michael Palin's private archive, which he donated to the British Library in 2017, do document at least one alternative ending that the troupe considered: \"a battle between the knights of Camelot, the French, and the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog\". Due to the film's small production budget, that idea for a \"much pricier option\" was discarded by the Pythons in favour of the ending with \"King Arthur getting arrested\", which Palin deemed \"cheaper\" and \"funnier\".</p><p>Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes offers a 96% approval rating from reviews of 83 critics, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The consensus reads, \"A cult classic as gut-bustingly hilarious as it is blithely ridiculous, <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i> has lost none of its exceedingly silly charm.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 91 out of 100 based on 24 critics' reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".</p>\n\n<h3><i>Spamalot</i></h3>\n<p>The film was adapted as the 2005 Tony Award-winning Broadway musical <i>Spamalot</i>. Written primarily by Idle, the stage show offers a revised plot, while retaining many jokes from the film.</p><p>In May 2018, 20th Century Fox green-lit a film adaptation of the musical. Idle would write the screenplay and stage director Casey Nicholaw would direct. Slated to begin filming in early 2019, production was delayed as a result of the acquisition of 20th Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company. The project announced a move to Paramount Pictures on January 6, 2020, with Idle and Nicholaw still attached as writer and director, and Dan Jinks joining as a producer. However, in 2021, Idle confirmed on his Twitter account that the film would not be made because two of his former colleagues opposed it.</p><p>A Broadway revival began previews on October 31, 2023 at the St. James Theatre, with an official opening night of November 16, 2023.</p><p>In 2013, the Pythons lost a legal case to Mark Forstater, the film's producer, owing a combined \u00a3800,000 in legal fees and back royalties to Forstater for the derivative work of <i>Spamalot</i>. To help cover the cost of these royalties and fees, the group arranged and performed in a stage show, <i>Monty Python Live (Mostly)</i>, held at the O<sub>2</sub> Arena in London in July 2014.</p>\n\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul><li>List of films considered the best</li>\n<li>Postmodernist film</li>\n<li>Production music</li></ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<h3>Bibliography</h3>\n<ul><li><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1133582631\"><cite id=\"CITEREFLarsen2015\" class=\"citation book cs1\">Larsen, Darl (2015). \"Title and Credit Sequence\". <i>A Book about the Film Monty Python and the Holy Grail: All the References from African Swallows to Zoot</i>.
