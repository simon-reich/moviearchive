Romance sparks between the two but doesn't last long when Baku suddenly disappears from her life. Two years later, she spots a man that bears a striking resemblance to him. Even though it is only his physical similarities to Baku that attracted her to him, she doesn't say so and starts dating the soft-spoken young man called Ryohei.",

It was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival. It is based on a 2010 novel by Tomoka Shibasaki about a woman who falls in love with two men who look the same but act completely differently.",
    "wikipedia_plot": "Asako, a young woman who lives in Osaka, experiences love at first sight when she encounters Baku. The two begin a whirlwind relationship against the advice from Asako's friend, who only believes Baku will hurt her. After spending the night at Baku's place, Asako awakens to find him missing. It's explained that Baku suddenly disappears from time to time and it's been that way since his father died. Baku returns to Asako's avail, and they embrace. Baku tells Asako that he will always return to her. A voice-over explains that Baku suddenly disappears once again, and they lose touch with each other.\nTwo years later, Asako is living in Tokyo and works at a coffee shop. She encounters a businessman named Ryohei, who works at a nearby Japanese sake company. He is nearly identical to Baku in physical appearance, and Asako believes it is him at first and even verbally greets him with Baku's name. Only after some tentative verbal exchange does Asako accept that it is not Baku but another young man. Ryohei doesn't understand why Asako treats him oddly and with tentativeness.

One day, Asako learns that Baku has become a famous actor and model.
