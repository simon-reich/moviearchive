She sees another student, Pat Hingle, flee the school in terror. Suzy is refused entry to the school and forced to stay in town overnight. Pat takes refuge at a friend's apartment and tells her that something sinister happened at the school. Pat is ambushed by a shadowy figure who stabs her repeatedly and drags her to the roof of the apartment building before hanging her with a noose by throwing her through the building's skylight. Pat's friend is also killed after being impaled by a falling giant shard of glass while trying to alert other tenants to the murder.\nSuzy returns to the school the next morning, where she meets Miss Tanner, the head instructor, and Madame Blanc, the deputy headmistress. Tanner introduces Suzy to Pavlos, one of the school's servants. She also meets classmates Sara and Olga, her new roommate. Suzy experiences an unsettling encounter with one of the school's matrons and Blanc's nephew, Albert, before passing out during a dance class. When she regains consciousness, Suzy learns that Olga has thrown her out of her apartment, forcing her to live at the school with Sara in the room next door.\nWhile the students are preparing for supper one night, maggots rain down from the ceilings of their rooms due to a shipment of spoiled food in the attic, forcing them to sleep in one of the dance studios. During the night, a woman enters the room but is obscured by a curtain hung around the room's perimeter. Sara, frightened by her hoarse and labored breathing, recognizes her as the school's headmistress, who is supposedly out of town.

She reveals that Pat was behaving strangely before her death and promises to show Suzy the notes that she left behind. Sara finds that Pat's notes are missing and is forced to flee when an unseen assailant enters the room. They pursue her through the school before cornering her in the attic.

John Stark of The San Francisco Examiner was critical, writing: \"Suspiria is mostly gore, with little plot or intrigue.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune expressed similar sentiments, criticizing Harper's role to being \"reduced to cowering in corners\" and \"costumed to look much younger than her years\"; while praising Argento's \"visually stylish\" direction, he felt that Suspiria was inferior to his directorial debut The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1970) and \"plays like a weak imitation of The Exorcist (1973)\".Like Siskel, Bruce McCabe of The Boston Globe likened the film to The Exorcist and The Sentinel (1977), ultimately deeming it \"a fitful, uneven piece of work too often more uncontrolled than the hysteria it's trying to create.\" Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader gave a favorable review, claiming that \"Argento works so hard for his effects\u2014throwing around shock cuts, colored lights and peculiar camera angles\u2014that it would be impolite not to be a little frightened\".

Critic Maitland McDonagh notes: \"In Argento's reading [of the material], the three mothers generate/inhabit a cinematic world informed by Jungian archetypal imagery, each holding sway over a particular city.\" Argento said the idea for the film came to him after a trip through several European cities, including Lyon, Prague, and Turin. He became fascinated by the \"Magic Triangle\", a point where the countries of France, Germany, and Switzerland meet; this is where Rudolf Steiner, a controversial social reformer and occultist, founded an anthroposophic community. Commenting on witchcraft and the occult, Argento stated: \"There's very little to joke about. It's something that exists.\" The title and general concept of \"The Three Mothers\"\u2014a concept Argento would expand upon in <i>Inferno</i> and <i>Mother of Tears\u2014</i>came from De Quincey's essay, which was an uncredited inspiration for the film. There is a section in the work entitled \"Levana and Our Ladies of Sorrow\". The piece asserts that just as there are three Fates and three Graces, there are three Sorrows: \"Mater Lacrymarum, Our Lady of Tears\", \"Mater Suspiriorum, Our Lady of Sighs\", and \"Mater Tenebrarum, Our Lady of Darkness\".\n</p><p>Daria Nicolodi helped Argento write the screenplay for the film, which combined the occult themes that interested Argento with fairytales that were inspiring to Nicolodi, such as <i>Bluebeard</i>, <i>Pinocchio</i>, and <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>. Nicolodi also partially based her contributions to the screenplay on a personal story her grandmother had told her, in which her grandmother had gone to take a piano lesson at an unnamed academy where she believed she encountered black magic. The encounter terrified her grandmother, prompting her to flee. This story, however, was later said by Argento to have been fabricated. Using Nicolodi's core ideas, Argento helped co-write the screenplay, which he chose to set at a dance academy in Freiburg im Breisgau, near the German borders with Switzerland and France. The lead character of Suzy Bannion was based on Snow White. Initially, the characters in the film were very young girls\u2014around eight to ten years old\u2014but this was altered when the film's producers were hesitant to make a film with all young actors. Additionally, the final sequence of the film was based on a dream Nicolodi had while she was staying in Los Angeles.</p>\n\n<h3>Casting</h3>\n<p>American actress Jessica Harper was cast in the lead role of American ballet dancer Suzy Bannion, after attending an audition via the William Morris Agency. Argento chose Harper based on her performance in Brian De Palma's <i>Phantom of the Paradise</i> (1974). Upon being cast in the film, Harper watched Argento's <i>Four Flies on Grey Velvet</i> (1971) to better understand the director's style. Harper turned down a role in Woody Allen's <i>Annie Hall</i> (1977) in order to appear in the film.</p><p>Argento requested Italian actress Stefania Casini for the supporting role of Sara, a request which she obliged, having been an admirer of his films. Daria Nicolodi had originally planned on playing the role of Sara, but was unable to due to an injury, and Casini was brought in at the last minute. German actor Udo Kier was cast in the minor supporting role of Frank Mandel.</p>\n\n<h3>Filming</h3>\n<p>The majority of <i>Suspiria</i> was shot at De Paoli studios in Rome, where key exterior sets (including the fa\u00e7ade of the academy) were constructed. Actress Harper described the film shoot as \"very, very focused\", as Argento \"knew exactly what he was looking for\". The fa\u00e7ade of the academy was replicated on a soundstage from the real-life Whale House in Freiburg. Additional photography took place in Munich, including Daniel's death scene in the <i>K\u00f6nigsplatz</i> square, as well as the opening scene of the film, which was shot on location at the Munich Airport. The scene in which Suzy meets with Dr. Mandel was filmed outside the BMW Headquarters building in Munich.</p>\n<p><i>Suspiria</i> is noteworthy for several stylistic flourishes that have become Argento trademarks, particularly the use of set-piece structures that allow the camera to linger on pronounced visual elements. Cinematographer Luciano Tovoli was hired by Argento to shoot the film, based on color film tests he had completed, which Argento felt matched his vision, in part inspired by <i>Snow White</i> (1937). The film was shot using anamorphic lenses. The production design and cinematography emphasize vivid primary colors, particularly red, creating a deliberately unrealistic, nightmarish setting, emphasized by the use of imbibition Technicolor prints. Commenting on the film's lush colors, Argento said: </p><blockquote><p>We were trying to reproduce the colour of Walt Disney's <i>Snow White</i>; it has been said from the beginning that Technicolor lacked subdued shades, [and] was without nuances\u2014like cut-out cartoons.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The imbibition process, used for <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> (1939) and <i>Gone with the Wind</i> (1939), is much more vivid in its color rendition than emulsion-based release prints, therefore enhancing the nightmarish qualities of the film Argento intended to evoke. It was one of the final feature films to be processed in Technicolor, using the last remaining machine in Rome.</p>\n\n<h3>Post-production</h3>\n<h4>Dubbing</h4>\n<p>All of the actors' dialogue was dubbed through additional dialogue recording\u2014a common practice in Italian filmmaking at the time.</p>\n\n<h4>Musical score</h4>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>The Italian progressive rock band Goblin composed most of the film's score in collaboration with Argento himself. Goblin had scored Argento's earlier film <i>Deep Red</i> as well as several films following <i>Suspiria</i>. In the film's opening credits, they are referred to as \"The Goblins\". Like Ennio Morricone's compositions for Sergio Leone, Goblin's score for <i>Suspiria</i> was created before the film was shot. It has been reused in multiple Hong Kong films, including Yuen Woo-ping's martial arts film <i>Dance of the Drunk Mantis</i> (1979) and Tsui Hark's horror-comedy <i>We're Going to Eat You</i> (1980).\n</p><p>The main title theme was named as one of the best songs released between 1977 and 1979 in the book <i>The Pitchfork 500: Our Guide to the Greatest Songs from Punk to the Present</i>, compiled by music website Pitchfork. It has been sampled on the Raekwon and Ghostface Killah song \"Legal Coke\", from the R. A. G. U. mix tape, by RJD2 for the song \"Weather People\" by Cage and by Army of the Pharaohs in their song \"Swords Drawn\".\n</p>\n\n<h2>Release</h2>\n<p><i>Suspiria</i> was released in Italy on 1 February 1977. 20th Century Fox acquired the American distribution rights; due to its violent content, they were hesitant to release <i>Suspiria</i>, but eventually premiered the film in July 1977 through a shell company, International Classics. The original American prints were cut by a total of eight minutes in order for the film to pass with an R-rating. Despite initial reservations, the film's American release was commercially successful, and proved to be Fox's seventh highest-grossing release of the year in theatrical rentals. Of all of Argento's films, <i>Suspiria</i> was his highest\u2013grossing in the United States.</p>\n\n<h3>Critical response</h3>\n<p>Janet Maslin of <i>The New York Times</i> wrote a mixed review, saying the film had \"slender charms, though they will most assuredly be lost on viewers who are squeamish.\" The <i>Los Angeles Times</i><span>'</span>s Kevin Thomas wrote that the film was \"consistently suspenseful and diverting\" despite being \"marred by stilted, poorly dubbed English dialogue\".

In the book <i>European Nightmares: Horror Cinema in Europe Since 1945</i> (2012), the film is noted for being an \"exemplar of Eurohorror<span>\u00a0</span>... it is excessive but here the excess seems to entail a more forceful retardation of a narrative drive, to the extent that the narrative periodically ceases to exist.\" <i>Suspiria</i> has been praised by film historians and critics for its emphasized employment of color and elaborate set-pieces; film scholar John Kenneth Muir notes that \"each and every frame of <i>Suspiria</i> is composed with an artistic, remarkable attention to color.\"</p><p><i>The Village Voice</i> ranked <i>Suspiria</i> #100 on their list of the 100 greatest films made in the 20th century. Adam Smith of <i>Empire</i> magazine awarded the film a perfect score of five out of five. <i>Empire</i> magazine also ranked <i>Suspiria</i> #312 on their list of the 500 greatest films ever as well as number 45 on their list 'The 100 Best Films of World Cinema'. AllMovie called it \"one of the most striking assaults on the senses ever to be committed to celluloid<span>\u00a0</span>... this unrelenting tale of the supernatural was\u2014and likely still is\u2014the closest a filmmaker has come to capturing a nightmare on film.\" <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> ranked <i>Suspiria</i> #18 on their list of the 25 scariest films ever. A poll of critics of <i>Total Film</i> ranked it #3 on their list of the 50 greatest horror films ever. One of the film's sequences was ranked at #24 on Bravo's <i>The 100 Scariest Movie Moments</i> program. IGN ranked it #20 on their list of the 25 best horror films.</p><p>On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 93% score based on 61 retrospectively collected reviews, with an average rating of 8.40/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"The blood pours freely in Argento's classic <i>Suspiria</i>, a giallo horror as grandiose and glossy as it is gory.\" Rotten Tomatoes also ranked it #61 on their list of the top 100 horror movies. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".</p>\n\n<h3>Home media</h3>\n<p><i>Suspiria</i> was released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in a three-disc set on 11 September 2001. This release, which was a limited edition run restricted to 60,000 units, features a THX-certified video master of the film, with a second disc consisting of a 52-minute documentary and other bonus material; the third disc is a CD consisting of the original film score. This release also includes a 28-page booklet and ten lobby card and poster reproductions. Goblin frontman Claudio Simonetti later formed the heavy-metal band Daemonia; the DVD also contains a video of the band playing a reworking of the <i>Suspiria</i> theme. A standard single-disc edition was released by Anchor Bay the following month.</p><p>On 19 December 2017, the independent home media distributor Synapse Films released the film for the first time on Blu-ray in the United States in a limited steelbook package. This release also consists of three discs which include a 4K restoration of the feature film, bonus materials, and the original score on a compact disc. A wide-release version not containing the soundtrack CD was released on 13 March 2018. On 19 November 2019, Synapse released their restoration in 4K but without the soundtrack CD nor an accompanying Blu-ray disc.</p><p>In Italy, the film received a 4K-remastered Blu-ray release via the Italian distributor Videa in February 2017. It did not use the same 4K restoration as the US Synapse release.</p>\n\n<h2>Legacy</h2>\n<p>Three bands\u2014the Norwegian thrash-metal band Susperia; a pioneering mid-1990s UK gothic rock band, Suspiria; and the witch-house project Mater Suspiria Vision\u2014have named themselves after the film. Several albums have also used the title, including an album by gothic metal band Darkwell, an album by Darkwave band Miranda Sex Garden and <i>Suspiria de Profundis</i> by Die Form, which can also be regarded as inspired by Thomas De Quincey's work of the same title. The film's music has also been imitated and sampled by various artists, including Ministry in the track \"Psalm 69\" from their album <i>Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs</i>, Cage Kennylz on \"Weather People\" and Atmosphere on \"Bird Sings Why the Caged I Know\". The American death metal band Infester included a sample from the film in their song, \"Chamber of Reunion\", from their album <i>To the Depths, In Degradation</i> (1994). The Houston, Texas-based Two Star Symphony Orchestra included a track titled \"Goblin Attack\" on their 2004 CD <i>Danse Macabre: Constant Companion</i> that features a strings rendition of the <i>Suspiria</i> theme; the track's title also appears to be a reference to the band Goblin. The 69 Eyes have a song called \"Suspiria Snow White\" on their album <i>Back in Blood</i> (2009). In 1991, the California-based instrumental band Gargamel recorded a version of the <i>Suspiria</i> theme featuring dulcimer and tape manipulations amongst their covers of horror film soundtrack compositions.</p><p>A section of the soundtrack cue \"Markos\" was incorporated into the Australian radiophonic work <i>What's Rangoon to You is Grafton to Me</i>, conceived and written by radio presenter and author Russell Guy, co-narrated by Guy and former ABC-TV newsreader James Dibble, and co-produced by Guy and Graham Wyatt. It was originally broadcast in 1978 on the ABC's \"youth\" radio station 2JJ aka Double Jay (the Sydney-based AM-band precursor to the current Triple J network).</p><p>In books by Simon R. Green, mentions are often made of a \"Black Forest Dance Academy\" in Germany, a place where witches and Satanists gather, a possible reference to <i>Suspiria</i>.</p><p><i>Suspiria</i> is featured in the documentary film <i>Terror in the Aisles</i> (1984). In the comedy-drama film <i>Juno</i> (2007), <i>Suspiria</i> is considered by the title character to be the goriest film ever made, until she is shown <i>The Wizard of Gore</i> and changes her mind, saying it is actually gorier than <i>Suspiria</i>. The film is also mentioned in the episode \"The Seminar\" of <i>The Office</i> (season 7), Kirby Reed's horror film collection in the horror film <i>Scream 4</i> (2011), and in Ryan Murphy\u2019s <i>American Horror Story: Hotel</i> where a character watches <i>Suspiria</i> on television.</p><p>In March 2020, a new score, featuring members of King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard alongside other Melbourne musicians, was performed live with a screening of the film.</p>\n\n<h2>Related works</h2>\n<h3>Subsequent films</h3>\n<p><i>Suspiria</i> is the first of a trilogy of films by Argento, referred to as \"The Three Mothers\". The trilogy centers around three witches, or \"Mothers of Sorrow\" who unleash evil from three locations in the world. In <i>Suspiria</i>, Helena Marcos is <i>Mater Suspiriorum</i> (<abbr style=\"font-size:85%\" title=\"literal translation\">lit.</abbr> Latin: \"Mother of Sighs\") in Freiburg. Argento's 1980 film <i>Inferno</i> focuses on <i>Mater Tenebrarum</i> (<abbr style=\"font-size:85%\" title=\"literal translation\">lit.</abbr> Latin: \"Mother of Darkness\"), in New York City. The final installment in the trilogy, <i>The Mother of Tears</i> (2007), focuses on <i>Mater Lachrymarum</i> (<abbr style=\"font-size:85%\" title=\"literal translation\">lit.</abbr> Latin: \"Mother of Tears\") in Rome.</p><p>Film scholar L. Andrew Cooper notes \"Aesthetic experience is arguably the ultimate source of 'meaning' in all of Argento's films, but <i>Suspiria</i> and the other films of the Three Mothers trilogy...take their emphasis on aesthetics further by self-consciously connecting their irrational worlds to nineteenth-century romanticism and the aestheticism that grew out of it.\"</p>\n\n<h3>Unfilmed remake</h3>\n<p>It was announced through MTV in 2008 that a remake of <i>Suspiria</i> was in production, to be directed by David Gordon Green, who directed films such as <i>Undertow</i> and <i>Pineapple Express</i>. The announcement was met with hostility by some, including Argento himself. The film was to be produced by Italian production company First Sun. In August 2008, it was reported that Natalie Portman and Annette Savitch's Handsome Charlie Films were set to produce the remake, and that Portman would play the lead role. The project was also announced to be produced by Marco Morabito and Luca Guadagnino. After a period of no news in which it was thought that the remake attempt had failed, Green said in August 2011 that he was still trying to remake the film. It was announced on 15 May 2012 that actress Isabelle Fuhrman would be cast as the lead. Later that year, however, the planned remake was put on hold. In January 2013, Green revealed that it might never happen due to legal issues. In April 2014, Green admitted the remake was too expensive to make during the \"found-footage boom\", and thus the film was ultimately not made.</p><p>In April 2015, an English-language television series based on the film\u2014along with a series based on Sergio Corbucci's <i>Django</i> (1966)\u2014was announced as being developed by Atlantique Productions and Cattleya. Both series were set to consist of twelve 50-minute long episodes, with the possibility of multiple seasons.</p>\n\n<h3>2018 film</h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>In September 2015, Italian director Gianluca Guadagnino announced at the 72nd Venice Film Festival that he would direct a new version of <i>Suspiria</i>, with the intention of using the cast of his film <i>A Bigger Splash</i> (Tilda Swinton, Matthias Schoenaerts, Ralph Fiennes, and Dakota Johnson). In the lead-up to filming, Johnson stated that she was undertaking ballet training to prepare. On 23 November 2015, Guadagnino revealed shooting would begin in August 2016. In October 2016, it was announced that Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz would co-star, alongside Johnson and Swinton. The film finished shooting on 10 March 2017 in Berlin. The film was described by Guadagnino as an \"homage\" to the 1977 film rather than a direct remake. Guadagnino's version is set in Berlin circa 1977 (the year in which Argento's film was released), with a thematic focus on \"the uncompromising force of motherhood\".</p>\n\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<ul><li>1978 Nominated Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Joan Bennett</li>\n<li>2002 Nominated Saturn Award for Best DVD Classic Film Release</li>\n<li>2018 Won Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Award in the following categories (Synapse):<ul><li>Best DVD/Blu-ray</li>\n<li>Best Restoration</li>\n<li>Best DVD Commentary \u2013 David Del Valle and Derek  Botelho</li>\n<li>Best DVD extra \u2013 <i>A Sigh from the Depths: 40 Years of Suspiri</i>, directed by Daniel Griffith</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul><li>Gothic film \u00a7\u00a0Notable films</li></ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<h3>Bibliography</h3>\n<ul><li><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1133582631\"><cite id=\"CITEREFAllmerHuxleyBrick2012\" class=\"citation book cs1\">Allmer, Patricia; Huxley, David; Brick, Emily (2012). <i>European Nightmares: Horror Cinema in Europe Since the 1945</i>.
