    "wikipedia_plot": "Sarah O\u2019Neill and her shy, arachnophobic son Christopher (\"Chris\") move to the Irish countryside. While driving home, Sarah and Chris get into a car accident when she almost hits an old woman named Noreen Brady standing in the middle of the road. \nAfter returning home, Sarah and Chris have an argument about Chris\u2019s father, and Chris runs into the forest. Sarah follows Chris and finds him near a large sinkhole. At a dinner party, Sarah's friends recount the tale that Noreen believed her son James was not her real son and is rumored to have murdered him with a car. \nLater that night, Sarah awakens to sounds downstairs and finds Chris missing from his bedroom.
