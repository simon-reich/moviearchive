While struggling to adapt \"The Orchid Thief,\" by Susan Orlean, Kaufman's life spins from pathetic to bizarre. The lives of Kaufman, Orlean's book, become strangely intertwined as each one's search for passion collides with the others'.",

    "wikipedia_summary": "Adaptation is a 2002 American meta comedy-drama film directed by Spike Jonze and written by Charlie Kaufman. It features an ensemble cast led by Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep, and Chris Cooper, with Cara Seymour, Brian Cox, Tilda Swinton, Ron Livingston, and Maggie Gyllenhaal in supporting roles.\nKaufman based Adaptation on his struggles to adapt Susan Orlean's 1998 nonfiction book The Orchid Thief while suffering from writer's block. It involves elements adapted from the book, plus fictitious elements, including Kaufman's twin brother (also credited as a writer for the film) and a romance between Orlean and John Laroche (Chris Cooper). It culminates in completely invented elements, including versions of Orlean and Laroche three years after the events of The Orchid Thief.\nAdaptation was praised for its direction, screenplay, humor, and the performances of Cage, Cooper, and Streep. It received awards at the 75th Academy Awards, 60th Golden Globe Awards, and 56th British Academy Film Awards, with Cooper winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and Kaufman winning the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. A British Film Institute poll ranked it one of the thirty best films of the 2000s.",

Already well past his deadline with Columbia Pictures and despairing of writing his script with self-reference, Charlie travels to New York City to discuss the screenplay with Orlean directly. Too shy and socially awkward to speak with her upon arriving at her office and after he received the surprising news that Donald's spec script for a clich\u00e9d psychological thriller, The 3, is selling for six or seven figures, Charlie resorts to attending McKee's seminar in New York and asks him for advice. Charlie ends up asking Donald to join him in New York to assist with the story structure.\nDonald, who is confident socially, pretends to be Charlie and interviews Orlean but finds her responses suspicious. He and Charlie follow Orlean to Florida, where she meets John Laroche, the orchid-stealing protagonist of her book and her secret lover.

Cage took the role for a $5 million salary, and wore a fatsuit during filming.</p><p>Streep expressed strong interest in the role of Susan Orlean before being cast, and took a salary cut in recognition of the film's budget. John Turturro was approached to portray John Laroche. Cooper strongly considered turning down Laroche, but accepted it after his wife urged him to. Albert Finney, Christopher Plummer, Terence Stamp and Michael Caine were considered for the role of Robert McKee, but McKee personally suggested Brian Cox to filmmakers.</p><p>John Cusack, Catherine Keener, John Malkovich, Lance Acord, Thomas Patrick Smith, and Spike Jonze have uncredited cameos as themselves in scenes where Charlie Kaufman is on the set of <i>Being John Malkovich</i>, which he also wrote. Additional cameos include director Curtis Hanson as Orlean's husband, and David O. Russell as a <i>New Yorker</i> journalist.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>The idea to do a film adaptation of Susan Orlean's <i>The Orchid Thief</i> dates back to 1994. Fox 2000 purchased the film rights in 1997, eventually selling them to Jonathan Demme, who set the project at Columbia Pictures. Charlie Kaufman was hired to write the script, but struggled with the adaptation and writer's block. Kaufman eventually created a script of his experience in adaptation, exaggerating events and creating a fictional twin brother. He put Donald Kaufman's name on the script and dedicated the film to him. By September 1999, Kaufman had written two drafts of the script; he turned in a third draft in November 2000.</p><p>Kaufman said, \"The idea of how to write the film didn't come to me until quite late. It was the only idea I had, I liked it, and I knew there was no way it would be approved if I pitched it. So I just wrote it and never told the people I was writing it for. I only told Spike Jonze, as we were making <i>Being John Malkovich</i> and he saw how frustrated I was. Had he said I was crazy, I don't know what I would have done\". He also said, \"I really thought I was ending my career by turning that in!\"</p><p><i>Adaptation</i> went on fast track in April 2000, with Kaufman making some revisions. Scott Brake of <i>IGN</i> gave the script a positive review in June 2000, as did Drew McWeeny of <i>Ain't It Cool News</i> in October. Columbia Pictures committed to North America distribution only after Intermedia came aboard to finance the film in exchange for international distribution rights. Filming started in late March 2001 in Los Angeles and finished by June. The \"evolution\" fantasy sequence was created by Digital Domain, while Skywalker Sound handled audio post production services.\nThe makeup effects (the Nicolas Cage double, Chris Cooper's teeth, and the alligator attack) are by makeup effects designer Tony Gardner and his effects company Alterian, Inc.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Release</h2>\n<p>Columbia Pictures at one point announced a late 2001 theatrical release date, but <i>Adaptation</i> opened on December 6, 2002, in the United States for a limited release. The film was released nationwide on February 14, 2003, earning $1,130,480 in its opening weekend in 672 theaters. It went on to gross $22.5 million in North America and $10.3 million in foreign countries, for a total of $32.8 million.</p>\n\n<h3>Home media</h3>\n<p><i>Adaptation</i> was released on DVD and VHS by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment in May 2003. Image Entertainment released a bare-bones Blu-ray in 2012, which was followed in 2020 by another release through Shout! Factory.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n<h3>Critical response</h3>\n<p>On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 211 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Dizzyingly original, the loopy, multi-layered <i>Adaptation</i> is both funny and thought-provoking.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".

In 2012, she said, \"[reading the screenplay] was a complete shock. My first reaction was 'Absolutely not!' They had to get my permission and I just said: 'No! Are you kidding? This is going to ruin my career!' Very wisely, they didn't really pressure me. They told me that everybody else had agreed and I somehow got emboldened. It was certainly scary to see the movie for the first time. It took a while for me to get over the idea that I had been insane to agree to it, but I love the movie now.\"\n</p><p>Orlean called Streep's portrayal of her \"one of my favorite performances by her\" and appreciated that her version of the character was based not on the real Orlean but on how Streep imagined Orlean based on <i>The Orchid Thief</i>.
