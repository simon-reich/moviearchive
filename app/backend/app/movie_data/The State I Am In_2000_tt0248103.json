Originally given a limited release (1,000 copies) by Electric Honey, the album was subsequently re-released in 1999 by Jeepster Records.\n</p><p>The album is named after an instrumental that did not end up on the album \u2013 it was later performed on Belle and Sebastian's early tours.  All of the songs on the album were written by Stuart Murdoch between 1993 and 1996, and originally performed solo on the Glasgow open mic circuit. Though he performs on the album, trumpet player Mick Cooke was not then an official member of the band.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Recording and production</h2>\n<p>Belle and Sebastian formed after vocalist Stuart Murdoch and bassist Stuart David met at a caf\u00e9 in Glasgow, Scotland in January 1996. The pair reportedly enlisted the first five musicians they came across, settling on a line-up of Murdoch, David, guitarist Stevie Jackson, drummer Richard Colburn, keyboardist Chris Geddes and cellist Isobel Campbell. Their initial performances took places at venues such as church crypts, libraries and house parties. Concurrently, Murdoch attended a music business course at the local Stow College, ran by Alan Rankine of the Associates. The end goal of the course was to take two songs from the class and record and release them through Rankine's record label Electric Honey. Murdoch's material was eventually chosen; the band subsequently spent three days recording, finishing with an album's worth of songs.</p><p>Him and Colburn provided a demo tape the group had recorded titled <i>Rhode Island</i> (later released as the <i>Dog on Wheels</i> EP) and the college was extremely impressed and chose to support them in creating a full album.</p><p>Murdoch recalls that the group was still quite loose knit at the time <i>Tigermilk</i> was recorded and that the full ensemble had not played together before getting into the studio. Many of the supporting instrument parts were shaped as the group recorded. After recording, though, \"we were a group, no question.\"</p>\n\n<h2>Composition</h2>\n<p>Author Dave Thompson, in his book <i>Alternative Rock</i> (2000), called it as a \"gentle masterpiece, utterly in debt to Nick Drake (and a bit of Donovan too)\". He said \"The State I Am In\", the album's opening track, \"buoys the occasional sag; that and the slickly loose instrumentation, harmonies which haunt the fringe of fear, and a wealth of emotionally crippled reflection.\" Nine of the ten songs featured on the album were recorded live over a three-day period, followed by two days of mixing. The only track not recorded during these sessions, \"Electronic Renaissance\", originated as a demo Murdoch made at Beatbox using Cubase, and was mastered directly from a cassette recording Murdoch had made of the song being played on a local radio station, hence its lo-fidelity sound. Due to its stylistic difference from the other songs, its inclusion on the album initially proved controversial.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Release</h2>\n<p>Electric Honey issued <i>Tigermilk</i> in mid-1996, initially limited to 1,000 copies, which sold out in months. The band received praised from BBC radio DJs John Peel and Mark Radcliffe, subsequently earning them a radio session for the latter DJ in July 1996. Colburn said \"then record companies and fans started calling, and we thought 'My God, what have done?<span>'</span>\" By the following month, they had signed to the London-based label Jeepster Records. <i>Tigermilk</i>was reissued in 1999; by this point, copies of the original were being sold for $600.</p><p>The album's cover photograph was taken by Murdoch and features his girlfriend Joanne Kenney. Kenney also appeared on the cover of the <i>Dog on Wheels</i> EP.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Legacy</h2>\n<p><i>Tigermilk</i> was well-received upon its initial release, and earned a glowing review from Scottish culture magazine <i>The List</i>, who gave the band their first national press. The album has since sold over 124,000 copies. <i>Pitchfork</i> included \"The State I Am In\" at number 17 on their <i>Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s</i>. The album was included in the book <i>1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</i>.</p><p>An eBay charity auction of the stuffed animal in the cover art of the <i>Tigermilk</i> album in 2019  was won by Lisa Carr of Washington, DC.  Lisa Carr had also previously won an auction for bandleader Stuart Murdoch's car in 2002  and an auction of the stuffed animal on the cover of <i>Dog on Wheels</i> in 2004.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Track listing</h2>\n<h2>Personnel</h2>\n<ul><li>Stuart Murdoch \u2013 vocals, guitar, programming on \"Electronic Renaissance\"</li>\n<li>Stuart David \u2013 bass</li>\n<li>Isobel Campbell \u2013 cello</li>\n<li>Chris Geddes \u2013 keyboards, piano</li>\n<li>Richard Colburn \u2013 drums</li>\n<li>Stevie Jackson \u2013 guitar</li>\n<li>Mick Cooke \u2013 trumpet</li>\n<li>Joe Togher \u2013 violin</li>\n<li>Keith Jones \u2013 Korg Poly-61 synthesizer, sound manipulation on \"Electronic Renaissance\"</li></ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p><b>Citations</b>\n</p>\n\n<p><b>Sources</b>\n</p>\n\n<h2>External links</h2>\n<ul><li><i>Tigermilk</i> at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed)</li>\n<li>Album info Archived 27 April 2012 at the Wayback Machine</li></ul>"
