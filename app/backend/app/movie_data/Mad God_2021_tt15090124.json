    "wikipedia_plot": "A tall figure shrouded in a jacket and gas mask, credited as the assassin, descends into a ruined, hellish world via a diving bell. In his possession, the assassin has a map and a suitcase.\nTraveling through the underworld, the assassin encounters many creatures mercilessly preyed upon by larger monsters. Eventually, he reaches a city which is home to an army of faceless drones, apparently ruled by a monstrosity with filthy teeth and seared flesh who speaks in baby babble. Deep within the city's bowels, the assassin discovers a mountain of suitcases just like his own. The assassin opens his suitcase, revealing a timed bomb, which he places and prepares to set off. He fails to notice a creeping monster behind him, which then attacks and drags him away as the bomb's ticking hand appears unable to complete its circuit of the clock.\nThe assassin is shackled to a table and stripped in front of a mass of spectators.

His work on <i>Jurassic Park</i> led him to believe the days of stop-motion were over, and the film was shelved.</p><p>Twenty years later, with the encouragement of members of his studio, Tippett began working on the project again, utilizing crews of volunteers to assist him.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>\"So on the weekends I would get as many as 15 and 20 people coming round. They didn't all have the talent or skill, but I'd figure out the processes during the week. I had them do all the heavy lifting.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>With aid from Kickstarter donations, Tippett was able to create the first three sections, which make up about half of the film. Tippett released a behind-the-scenes footage on YouTube during production.</p>\n\n<h3>Sound Design</h3>\n<p>In 2013, Academy Award-winning sound designer Richard Beggs agreed to do the sound design and mix for the project.\n</p>\n\n<h3>VR-short</h3>\n<p>In 2016, a two-minute short VR-version of the movie was released. All characters were animated and shot separately in front of a green screen using Dragon software. Then Nuke was used to compose all the characters together in front of a background.</p>\n\n<h3>Music</h3>\n<p>The original score was composed by Dan Wool, who started work on the project in 2010 and developed the score in chapters until the release in 2021. The soundtrack album, released by Waxwork Records, came out June 21, 2022 on double-vinyl and CD.\n</p><p>In 2023 Wool released an alternative digital-only version of the soundtrack album called \"Soundtrack for Phil Tippett's MAD GOD - Music+Effects Version [feat.
