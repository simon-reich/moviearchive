It is based on German journalist J\u00fcrgen Hinzpeter's interactions with driver Kim Sa-bok; however, as very little information on Kim was  known at the time the film was made, most elements regarding his life and the events that happened to him outside of Gwangju are fictional.\nThe film was released on August 2, 2017, in South Korea.

    "wikipedia_plot": "In 1980, Kim Man-seob is a debt-laden widower who works as a taxi driver in Seoul. Overhearing another taxi driver bragging about a 100,000 won job to bring a foreign client to Gwangju, Man-seob steals the client, unaware of the events in Gwangju. The client is J\u00fcrgen \"Peter\" Hinzpeter, a German journalist wanting to report on the increasing civil unrest in Gwangju. The two men are stopped by soldiers as they approach Gwangju, but manage to enter with Peter posing as a businessman.\nIn Gwangju, they encounter a group of college students, who warm up to Peter and invites him aboard their pickup truck. Man-seob turns back, reluctant to be involved in the civil unrest. Along the way, he takes pity on an old woman and brings her to the local hospital to look for her son, who turns out to be one of the college students. Peter confronts Man-seob about abandoning him and offers to pay up part of the fare, but the college students and the local taxi drivers refuse to let Peter pay until Man-seob fulfils the agreed-upon trip.\nMan-seob takes Peter and another student Jae-sik to a protest at the Provincial Office, where protesters greet the trio with food and gifts. Peter films the crackdowns that followed. Plainclothed Defense Security Command (DSC) officers attempt to arrest Peter, but the three evade capture. That evening, Man-seob's taxi breaks down and Tae-soo, one of the local taxi drivers, tows the taxi to his shop for overnight repair and lets the men stay at his place for the night.

The officers recognize Peter and chase the three men; Man-seob is assaulted and Jae-sik is captured, but before he is taken away, he yells for Peter to share the footage with the world.\nDistressed about his young daughter and unable to contact her, Man-seob departs for Seoul the next morning with the fake Gwangju license plates Tae-soo has given him. In Suncheon, he overhears reports of the events in Gwangju; the media claims North Korean infiltrators caused the chaos. Overwhelmed with guilt, he drives back to the hospital in Gwangju to find Peter in shock and Tae-soo mourning over Jae-sik's corpse.

Man-seob and the other taxi drivers assist the wounded into the taxis and get them to safety. Departing for Seoul via a mountainous road, Man-seob and Peter arrive at an armed roadblock. The sergeant searches the car and finds the Seoul license plates but lets them go. The soldiers, receiving orders to stop any foreigners, open fire on the taxi but Man-seob breaks through.

Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter went further that especially in the checkpoint scene and the mountain-road chase scene, the cinematography captured a \"metal-on-metal violence\" which was exaggerated in a \"pastoral backdrop\" that made Kim\u2019s decision and reaction more convincing.

The film was a notable commercial success: it was the second highest grossing film of 2017 in South Korea, and currently stands as the thirteenth highest-grossing South Korean film in history.</p>\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<h3>Historical background</h3>\n<p>The film centers around the Gwangju Uprising that occurred from May 18, 1980 to May 27, 1980 and it is estimated to have led to 2,000 people being killed. The plot in the film mirrors the historical background of the Gwangju Uprisings.\n</p><p>The Gwangju Uprising was a result of a continuous power tug-of-war between the government and the citizens of South Korea \u2013 mainly college students \u2013 that were advocating for democracy.</p><p>For many years, Gwangju\u2019s Uprising was a forbidden term in South Korea \u2013 those who were on the side of the government during that time held the reins of nation. According to scholar Jang Se Young from the Wilson Center, \"books related to Gwangju were strictly censored or prohibited from even being published. Although a number of political dissidents and activists sought to inherit and develop the spirit of Gwangju, they were persecuted.\" Scholar Kim Yong Cheol stated, \"the political legacies the Gwangju Uprising produced played a pivotal role in checking military intervention in politics during the democratic transition as well as in establishing the principle of civilian supremacy during the democratic transition period.\" Despite being banned, hundreds and thousands of news articles on what was happening in Gwangju were trying to be released by some of the journalists inside the city.</p><p>Efforts were made by some American journalists in order to inform the world about what was happening in Gwangju. Tim Shorrock published numerous US government documents related to the uprisings that were happening in Gwangju, and Terry A. Anderson, who was a former AP correspondent, covered the uprisings himself and provided an eyewitness account of the situation in 1980.  People in Seoul were not aware of what was happening in Gwangju, until international media took hold of the story. Andrew David Jackson of Cambridge University argued that J\u00fcrgen Hinzpeter's relationship with South Korea's democratization movement \"have become important weapons for the activist generation in an ongoing struggle over the memorialization of the Gwangju Uprising.\"</p>\n\n<h4>Candlelight protests</h4>\n<p>Candlelight protests through the fall and winter of 2016-17 marked the thirtieth year of significant democratic advancement in South Korean history, compared to the setting in which <i>A Taxi Driver</i> took place. Harvard sociology professor Paul Y. Chang argued in 2018 in KOAJ that \"the contemporary candlelight protest industry draws on organizational and cultural resources first established in past democracy movements.\" During the filming of the movie, the director Jang Hoon was stopped multiple times, and the main actor of this film, Song Kang Ho, was blacklisted by the government from appearing on major motion picture films. Similar to the past, where newspaper articles and mass media coverage in South Korea was heavily monitored and censored, this movie faced obstacles as it reached its release date due to the former government\u2019s implications.</p>\n\n<h2>Plot</h2>\n<p>In 1980, Kim Man-seob is a debt-laden widower who works as a taxi driver in Seoul.

The film was available on 1,446 screens and was shown 7,068 times across South Korea. By noon on the second day of its run, the film had passed the one million viewer mark.</p><p>On the third day, the total audience doubled, attracting two million viewers. The viewer numbers continued to rise as the tickets sale increased to four million by the fourth day.</p><p><i>A Taxi Driver</i> has earned a total of <span>US$30.7 million</span> in five days with 4.38 million admissions.\nIt has tied with <i>The Admiral: Roaring Currents</i> and <i>The Battleship Island</i> for the record of films which have surpassed four million viewers in the first five days of release. At the end of the first seven days, the film surpassed 5 million admissions. On the eleventh day since the opening the film recorded more than 7 million viewers.</p><p><i>A Taxi Driver</i> became the most viewed South Korean film in 2017 in less than two weeks since its premiere by attracting more than 8 million audience.

It is also Song Kang-ho's third film to have sold more than 10 million tickets.</p><p>The film topped the South Korean box office for three consecutive weekends. By August 28, the film had attracted 11.4 million viewers. According to the film's distributor Showbox, the total attendance of the film surpassed the 12 million mark as of September 9, becoming the tenth most-watched local film of all time in South Korea.</p>\n\n<h3>Reactions in China</h3>\n<p><i>A Taxi Driver</i> is yet to be released in any form in China, though it received a theatrical release on September 21, 2017 in Hong Kong. The film has received warm responses from users on Chinese movie website Douban, where it had a high user rating. However at around 21:10, October 3, 2017, the film was entirely removed from the Chinese movie portal, the reason possibly being that a number of reviews had compared the film's content to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, which is strictly censored on media in China.</p>\n\n<h2>Fictionalized elements</h2>\n<p><i>A Taxi Driver</i> generally shows good accuracy on the memory of Gwangju Uprising, but several historical events depicted in the film are inaccurate and fictional.\n</p><p>The name of the taxi driver who helps Hinzpeter in the film is Kim Man-seob. He gives a false name, Kim Sa-bok, to Hinzpeter when he asks for Kim's name later in the film. However, in real life, the taxi driver\u2019s name was actually Kim Sa-bok. The only information known about the driver at the time during production was the name Kim Sa-bok, which was not registered as a taxi driver. Therefore, most of the character settings, including the \"real\" name Kim Man-seob, were created for the film.</p>\n<p>In the film, Kim Man-seob is a self-employed taxi driver, while Kim Sa-bok was a hotel taxi driver. Thus, his car was not a green taxi shown in the film but a black sedan. Kim Man-seob and J\u00fcrgen Hinzpeter were actually accompanied by Hinzpeter\u2019s sound technician Henning Rumohr. The massive car chase sequence in which the taxi drivers in Gwangju help Kim Man-seob and Hinzpeter escape did not happen. In reality, they escaped from Gwangju without incident on the pretext of doing business.</p><p>In the film, Kim Man-seob communicates with Hintzpeter in short English and is unable to speak English fluently. However, Kim Sa-bok was able to speak fluent English. Kim Man-seob in the film shows no interest in demonstrations and doesn't know what's happening in Gwangju. In real life, Kim Sa-bok was actually interested in democratic movements and explained the situation in Gwangju to Hinzpeter. In the film, J\u00fcrgen Hinzpeter is described as the only foreign press personnel to document the events in Gwangju. However, other foreign news reporters including Henry Scott-Stokes from <i>The New York Times</i> and Terry A. Anderson from Associated Press were in Gwangju covering the movement.</p><p>The film ends with footage of an interview from November 2015 with the real J\u00fcrgen Hinzpeter describing his fruitless efforts to find his driver Kim Sa-bok again, after the events of Gwangju. Hinzpeter died in January, 2016 without ever finding Kim Sa-bok. In 2017, the immense popularity of the film in South Korea brought the story of Kim Sa-bok to the attention of his son, Kim Seung-pil, who came forth publicly on Twitter and presented photographic evidence and details of his father's work with J\u00fcrgen Hinzpeter. The real Kim Sa-bok had a long term working relationship as a driver for J\u00fcrgen Hinzpeter, since at least 1975, and had died of liver cancer on December 19, 1984 at the age of 54. According to his son, Kim Sa-bok was traumatized by the terrible events at Gwangju and became a heavy drinker afterwards. Kim Sa-bok's death just a few years after the events depicted in the movie, and the fact that he was an independent driver not registered with any of the taxi companies were the reasons that J\u00fcrgen Hinzpeter had been unable to find him again when he returned later to Korea. The photographs presented by Kim Seung-pil were confirmed to be authentic by German broadcaster ARD and Hinzpeter's widow.</p>\n\n<h2>Awards and nominations</h2>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul><li>List of submissions to the 90th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film</li>\n<li>List of South Korean submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film</li></ul>\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1011085734\">\n\n<h2>External links</h2>\n<ul><li><i>A Taxi Driver</i> at the Korean Movie Database</li>\n<li><i>A Taxi Driver</i> at IMDb</li>\n<li><i>A Taxi Driver</i> at HanCinema</li>\n<li><i>A Taxi Driver</i> at Naver Movies <span>(in Korean)</span></li></ul>"
