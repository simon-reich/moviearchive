    "wikipedia_summary": "Hereditary is a 2018 American psychological supernatural horror film written and directed by Ari Aster in his feature directorial debut. Starring Toni Collette, Alex Wolff, Milly Shapiro, Ann Dowd, and Gabriel Byrne, the film follows a grieving family tormented by a demonic entity after the death of their secretive grandmother.\nAster's work on short horror films, most notably The Strange Thing About the Johnsons, attracted the attention of A24, who greenlit Hereditary as his first feature film. Aster conceived it as primarily a family drama consisting of two distinct halves. Filming took place in Utah in 2017, with most indoor scenes shot on custom built sets on a soundstage to give the film a dollhouse aesthetic.\nHereditary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 8, 2018. The film received widespread acclaim, with particular praise for Collette's performance, Aster's direction, and Stetson's score. It made over $82 million on a $10 million budget, becoming A24's highest-grossing film ever at the time, a record that was held until the release of Everything Everywhere All at Once in 2022.",

The family attends the funeral of Annie's secretive mother, Ellen, at which Annie is surprised at the number of mourners in attendance. She attends a bereavement support group, revealing her troubled childhood and that she and her mother had a fraught relationship until Charlie was born, when Ellen became a significant figure in raising her. Meanwhile, Steve receives a phone call telling him that unknown perpetrators desecrated Ellen's gravesite, but does not reveal this to Annie.\nPeter is invited to a party, and Annie insists that Charlie go with him. On the way to the party, the siblings pass a telephone pole carved with an occult sigil. At the party, Peter leaves Charlie unattended. She eats some chocolate cake, though unbeknownst to her, the cake has walnuts in it. Charlie has a severe nut allergy and thus goes into anaphylactic shock. As Peter drives Charlie to the hospital, she leans out of the window for air; when Peter swerves to avoid a dead deer lying in the road, she is decapitated by the sigil telephone pole. In shock, Peter drives home and leaves Charlie's headless body in the back seat of his parents' car, which Annie discovers to her horror the following morning. Following Charlie's death, Annie becomes resentful towards Peter, a traumatized Peter drifts through life in a daze, and Steve tries to continue life as normal.\nAnnie befriends a support group member named Joan. Joan teaches Annie to perform a s\u00e9ance to communicate with Charlie's ghost. Later that night, Annie convinces her family to attempt the s\u00e9ance. Objects begin to move and smash, and Peter is terrified when Annie is possessed and speaks in Charlie's voice until Steve throws water on her. As Peter begins to be haunted by supernatural forces, Annie suspects Charlie's spirit has become vengeful and demonic. When she sees images manifesting in Charlie's sketchbook threatening Peter, she throws the book into the fireplace. However, her clothing goes up in flames at the same time as the book does. Her clothes only stop burning when she pulls the book away from the flames. \nAnnie goes through her mother's old belongings, and finds a photo album that shows Ellen to have been \"Queen Leigh\", the leader of a coven, and Joan one of her acolytes. Another book describes the demon king Paimon, who wishes to inhabit the body of a male host. The summoner of Paimon will receive wealth and rewards. In the attic, Annie finds Ellen's rotting, decapitated body and occultist runes.\nWhile Peter is outside his school, Joan appears and attempts to expel his spirit from his body for the demon king. In class, Peter is taken over by an unseen force and slams his head against his desk, breaking his nose. Annie informs Steve of her ties to Charlie\u2019s sketchbook and begs him to burn it, as she cannot bring herself to take her own life. When he refuses, she snatches the book from him and flings it into the fire, only for Steve to burst into flames instead.\nAs naked coven members begin gathering both inside and around the house, Peter wakes after dark and finds his father's charred corpse, then quickly notices one of the coven members in a nearby doorway. A now-possessed Annie then chases him through the house. He attempts to hide in the attic; Annie follows him and then beheads herself with a piece of piano wire. Peter jumps from the attic window. A glowing orb enters and reanimates his body. Now displaying Charlie's mannerisms, he follows Annie's floating headless corpse into Charlie's treehouse, where Joan and other members of the coven\u2014as well as the headless corpses of Peter's mother and grandmother\u2014are worshipping a mannequin with Charlie's crowned, severed head placed on it. Joan removes the crown and places it on Peter's head, addressing him as Charlie. She then proclaims that Charlie is Paimon, they have \"corrected his female body\" and given him his preferred male host, and the coven hail Peter as King Paimon.",

    "wikipedia_critics": "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 385 reviews, and an average rating of 8.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Hereditary uses its classic setup as the framework for a harrowing, uncommonly unsettling horror film whose cold touch lingers long beyond the closing credits.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100, based on 49 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and called it the scariest movie of 2018, saying \"it's Collette, giving the performance of her career, who takes us inside Annie's breakdown in flesh and spirit and shatters what's left of our nerves. Her tour de force bristles with provocations that for sure will keep you up nights. But first, you'll scream your bloody head off.\" For The A.V. Club, A.A. Dowd gave the film an A\u2212, stating that, \"In its seriousness and hair-raising craftsmanship, Hereditary belongs to a proud genre lineage, a legacy that stretches back to the towering touchstones of American horror, unholy prestige-zeitgeist classics like The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby. Remarkably, it's a first feature, the auspicious debut of writer-director Ari Aster, whose acclaimed, disturbing short films were all leading, like a tunnel into the underworld, to this bleak vision.\" Common Sense Media gave the film four out of five stars and advised that it was suitable for viewers aged 17 or older.",

Kathleen Chalfant makes an uncredited appearance as Ellen Leigh, Annie's deceased mother. Aster refers to her as \"the sweetest person in the world\".</p>\n\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p>Writer-director Ari Aster embarked on a career in the film industry while a student at the American Film Institute; he wrote and directed two provocative short horror films, <i>The Strange Thing About the Johnsons</i> and <i>Munchausen</i>, bringing him under the scope of A24. Aster originally pitched <i>Hereditary</i> as a family tragedy, careful not to call it a horror film outright. A fan of domestic dramas, Aster incorporated themes of the genre into his script, envisioning a film rooted in family dynamics, trauma, and grief; <i>Carrie</i> and <i>The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover</i> were works Aster specified as influences on <i>Hereditary</i>. He interpreted the film as two halves which are \"completely inextricable from each other\": \"It begins as a family tragedy and then continues down that path, but gradually curdles into a full-bore nightmare.\"</p><p>The demon king Paimon originates from numerous grimoires, including <i>The Lesser Key of Solomon</i>, Johann Weyer's <i>Pseudomonarchia Daemonum</i>, Collin de Plancy's <i>Dictionnaire Infernal</i>, the <i>Livre des Esperitz</i>, the <i>Liber Officiorum Spirituum</i>, and <i>The Book of Abramelin</i>. According to <i>The Lesser Key of Solomon</i>, Paimon is a king of hell who commands 200 legions of spirits or angels. Paimon is obedient to Lucifer, and manifests with a crown on his head, heralded by a \"host of spirits, like men with trumpets and well sounding cymbals, and all other sorts of musical instruments\".</p>\n\n<h3>Casting</h3>\n<p>Toni Collette was one of the first actresses Aster sought for the role of Annie Graham, a miniaturist and the matriarch of the Graham family. Though Collette was reluctant to work on a horror film, the script's grounded approach to the genre convinced her to commit to the project: \"He [Aster] just really understood the dynamics in the family, has such an understanding of what it is to be human, what it is to experience loss\".</p><p>Gabriel Byrne agreed to play the family's patriarch Steve; Alex Wolff, who previously collaborated with Byrne in the HBO program <i>In Treatment</i>, was cast as the Grahams' son Peter. Cast in her cinema debut, 14-year-old Broadway theatre actress Milly Shapiro, winner of a Tony Honor for her performance in <i>Matilda the Musical</i>, earned the role of the daughter Charlie. After watching Shapiro's audition, Aster was immediately relieved \"'cause I knew the chances were slim that I would find somebody who would be right\", having left Charlie's personality more ambiguous than other characters in the script. Ann Dowd portrays grieving mother Joan, who convinces Annie of her ability to contact the dead.</p>\n\n<h3>Filming</h3>\n<p>The film began shooting in February 2017 in Utah. The exteriors of the Graham family house and the tree house were shot in Summit County, Utah, and the cemetery scene was filmed at Larkin Sunset Gardens in Sandy, Utah. The school scenes were shot at West High School and Utah State Fairpark, but all other interiors (including both versions of the treehouse) were built from scratch on a sound stage. Since each of the rooms was built on a stage, walls could be removed to shoot scenes at a much greater distance than a practical location would allow, creating the dollhouse aesthetic of the film.</p><p>Aster said that during filming, \"Alex Wolff told me not to say the name of William Shakespeare's Scottish play out loud because of some superstitious theater legend. I smugly announced the name, and then one of our lights burst during the shooting of the following scene.\"</p>\n\n<h3>Music</h3>\n<p>The soundtrack was produced by Colin Stetson and Rob Kleiner. Nick Allen of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> noted that the score incorporates trumpets during the film's climax, in reference to the mythology of Paimon being heralded by the sounds of trumpets.</p>\n\n<h2>Release</h2>\n<p><i>Hereditary</i> premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2018. The trailer for the film was released on January 30, 2018. On Anzac Day in 2018, the trailer for <i>Hereditary</i> played before the PG-rated family film <i>Peter Rabbit</i> in a cinema in Innaloo, Western Australia. According to a report in <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i>, the <i>Hereditary</i> preview was accidentally shown to family audiences and created a small panic in the theater. The theater was apparently full of families including \"at least 40 children\".</p><p>The film was released in the United States by A24 on June 8, 2018. It was released in the United Kingdom by Entertainment Film Distributors on June 15, 2018.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n<h3>Box office</h3>\n<p><i>Hereditary</i> grossed $44.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $38.8 million in other countries, for a total worldwide gross of $82.8 million, against a production budget of $10 million.</p><p>In the United States and Canada, <i>Hereditary</i> was released alongside <i>Ocean's 8</i> and <i>Hotel Artemis</i>, and was originally projected to gross $5\u20139 million in its opening weekend, similar to the debuts of previous A24 horror films <i>The Witch</i> ($8.8 million in 2016) and <i>It Comes at Night</i> ($6 million in 2017). It was also the widest-ever release for an A24 film with 2,964 theaters, besting the 2,553 of <i>It Comes at Night</i>. After making $5.2 million on its first day, including $1.3 million from Thursday night previews, weekend estimates were increased to $12 million. It went on to debut to $13.6 million, finishing fourth at the box office, behind <i>Ocean's 8</i>, <i>Solo: A Star Wars Story</i>, and <i>Deadpool 2</i>, and marking the best-ever opening for an A24 title. In its second weekend the film dropped just 49.5% to $6.9 million (compared to the 60\u201370% fall many horror films see in their sophomore frame), finishing sixth. On July 29, 2018, the film became A24's highest-grossing film worldwide at $80 million, beating <i>Lady Bird</i> ($78.5 million); it held the record until June 2022 when it was surpassed by <i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i>.</p>\n\n<h3>Critical response</h3>\n<p>On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 385 reviews, and an average rating of 8.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"<i>Hereditary</i> uses its classic setup as the framework for a harrowing, uncommonly unsettling horror film whose cold touch lingers long beyond the closing credits.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100, based on 49 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".</p><p>Writing for <i>Rolling Stone</i>, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and called it the scariest movie of 2018, saying \"it's Collette, giving the performance of her career, who takes us inside Annie's breakdown in flesh and spirit and shatters what's left of our nerves. Her tour de force bristles with provocations that for sure will keep you up nights. But first, you'll scream your bloody head off.\" For <i>The A.V. Club</i>, A.A. Dowd gave the film an A\u2212, stating that, \"In its seriousness and hair-raising craftsmanship, <i>Hereditary</i> belongs to a proud genre lineage, a legacy that stretches back to the towering touchstones of American horror, unholy prestige-zeitgeist classics like <i>The Exorcist</i> and <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>. Remarkably, it's a first feature, the auspicious debut of writer-director Ari Aster, whose acclaimed, disturbing short films were all leading, like a tunnel into the underworld, to this bleak vision.\" <i>Common Sense Media</i> gave the film four out of five stars and advised that it was suitable for viewers aged 17 or older.</p>\n\n<h3>Audience reception</h3>\n<p>Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"D+\" on an A+ to F scale. Some publications noted the critics-to-audience discrepancy, comparing it to <i>Drive</i>, <i>The Witch</i>, and <i>It Comes at Night</i>, all of which were critically acclaimed, but failed to impress mainstream moviegoers.</p>\n\n<h3>Accolades</h3>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<h2>External links</h2>\n\n<ul><li><span><span>Official website</span></span></li>\n<li><i>Hereditary</i> at IMDb</li>\n<li><i>Hereditary</i> at AllMovie</li>\n<li><i>Hereditary</i> at Metacritic </li>\n<li><i>Hereditary</i> at Rotten Tomatoes</li>\n<li><i>Hereditary</i> at Box Office Mojo</li></ul>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw\u2010api\u2010ext.eqiad.main\u201055c76dfb6f\u2010s98nq\nCached time: 20231206115603\nCache expiry: 3600\nReduced expiry: true\nComplications: [vary\u2010revision\u2010sha1, show\u2010toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.634 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.771 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 4858/1000000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 139899/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 6147/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 24/100\nExpensive parser function count: 3/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 1/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 173539/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.380/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 8595165/52428800 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%  673.086      1 -total\n 46.65%  313.984      1 Template:Reflist\n 35.95%  242.001     48 Template:Cite_web\n 11.77%   79.227      1 Template:Infobox_film\n 10.02%   67.465      1 Template:Ari_Aster\n  9.81%   66.011      1 Template:Navbox\n  9.78%   65.846      1 Template:Infobox\n  7.60%   51.186      1 Template:Short_description\n  6.04%   40.664      1 Template:IMDb_title\n  4.29%   28.873      2 Template:Pagetype\n-->"
