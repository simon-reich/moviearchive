    "wikipedia_summary": "The Beasts (Galician: As bestas) is a 2022 Spanish-French thriller film directed and produced by Rodrigo Sorogoyen, who wrote the screenplay with Isabel Pe\u00f1a. A co-production between Spain and France, it features Spanish, French, and Galician dialogue. It stars Denis M\u00e9nochet, Marina Fo\u00efs, Luis Zahera, Diego Anido and Marie Colomb.\nThe film is loosely inspired by real events involving a Dutch couple in Santoalla, a semi-abandoned hamlet of the Spanish municipality of Pet\u00edn, from 2010 to 2014. It follows a married French couple (M\u00e9nochet and Fo\u00efs) settled in the Galician countryside, exploring issues of xenophobia and escalating hostility between neighbors buoyed by a conflict vis-\u00e0-vis a wind farm project, arriving to a point of no return.\nThe film made its world premiere at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival on 26 May 2022, with a festival run that also included screenings in San Sebasti\u00e1n, Tokyo and Chicago. It was released theatrically in France on 20 July 2022 and in Spain on 11 November 2022. The Beasts earned a leading 17 nominations (including five for acting) at the 37th Goya Awards and won nine, including Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor for M\u00e9nochet, and Best Supporting Actor for Zahera. It also won the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film.",
    "wikipedia_plot": "Set in the Galician countryside, the story follows a French couple (Antoine and Olga Denis) settled in a small village seeking to connect with nature, growing and selling their own eco-friendly crops and rehabilitating abandoned properties so they can be reinhabited. However their presence arouses hostility from a couple of neighbors, the Anta brothers Xan (an inflexible man used to interacting under a might makes right worldview) and Lorenzo (with reduced mental capacity in the wake of an accident he suffered when he was young), pitted against the French at the opposing side of a dispute regarding the sale of land to a wind energy company. Antoine and Olga are opposed to the deal and block it, whilst Xan, along with most of the village, wants the money in order to leave the countryside and have a chance for a better life for him and his family. \nAntoine reports the hostile behaviour of the Anta brothers, such as trespassing on his farm and urinating on his property, to the local Guardia Civil, but they do not take his concerns seriously, insisting they should solve their dispute through dialogue. In an attempt to record evidence of their behaviour, Antoine begins surreptitiously filming the brothers, but they quickly notice and are enraged further. Antoine discovers two batteries in the farm's well, poisoning their tomato harvest with lead. He angrily confronts the brothers and trespasses in their residence. The law enforcement agents have no evidence to charge the brothers with sabotaging the farm and consider both parties responsible for antagonising each other. Driving along a country road at night, Antoine and Olga find the path blocked by the brothers' vehicle, who approach the couple with a shotgun and repeatedly bang on the window. Olga confesses she is fearful for their safety, believing they would have murdered Antoine if she was not present.\nThe other remaining villager opposed to the wind farm development dies, with his son in favour of accepting the deal and leaving Antoine and Olga the only remaining holdouts.  Antoine meets the brothers in the local pub and explains that, if another vote found him to be the only resident opposed to the deal, he would accept the majority opinion and leave the village. However, due to the sabotage of their harvest, they need to remain for at least a year to recoup their losses, by which time Xan believes the developers will take their interest elsewhere. Walking his dog in a remote forest, Antoine is followed and approached by the brothers. Anticipating a violent confrontation, he sets his camera to record and hides it in a clearing. A struggle ensues, and Antoine is smothered to death by the brothers. \nA year later, Antoine's disappearance remains unsolved. Olga continues to run the farm alone, and spends her free time scouring the countryside for Antoine's body or evidence of his murder. Antoine and Olga's daughter Marie arrives to visit from France. She is disturbed that Olga lives so near to her father's murderers, insisting that she needs to accept Antoine's death and leave, but Olga refuses. Olga eventually discovers the battered camera and gives the memory card to the Guardia Civil, but they tell her it is irretrievably corrupted. However, they agree to reopen the search around the site of the camera. Olga visits the Xan brothers and insists on speaking to their elderly mother. She tells the mother that her sons will soon be sent to prison, and then the two women will both be alone in the village. Shortly after, Antoine's body is discovered, and as Olga is driven to identify the body she passes the Xan brothers' mother walking alone in the road.",
