When he tells her that he's been thinking of doing some \"sick shit\" to her all morning, she replies that she doesn't care and submits to his anger. This results in sex that turns increasingly violent, ending with Milly screaming out in pain.\nAs Woodrow leaves Milly's house his shirt and hands are covered in blood, and he encounters Courtney in the street. She has a pistol and shoots herself in the head when he won't talk to her.\nThe film then back-tracks to when Woodrow has put Milly's things in a box, and gives an alternate series of events, much less apocalyptic, where Woodrow and Aiden light Milly's things on fire at the beach and then leave town.

The award was announced the day before <i>The Artist</i> won the Academy Award for Best Picture.  Eric Kohn of IndieWire criticized the inclusion of <i>The Artist</i> into awards that should recognize lesser known films, itemizing \"innovative cinematographer\" Hodge as one of the people harmed by the decision.  Screen Junkies also included both cinematographers among three it named Best Cinematographers for 2012.</p>\n\n<h3>Effects</h3>\n<p>Glodell and crew were also inventive in the effects they used in the filming.  Glodell constructed the flame thrower central to the theme, and modified the Medusa car.  To get a propane tank explosion, live bullets were fired into the tank, narrowly missing engineer/editor Jon Keevil's head.  It has been called one of the most dangerous film shoots in history.</p>\n\n<h2>Distribution</h2>\n<p>On January 27, 2011, six days after the premiere at Sundance, Oscilloscope Laboratories announced it had acquired English-language territory rights to the film. <i>Bellflower</i> was released in theaters August 5, 2011.</p><p>In non-English-speaking territories, Visit Films is the international sales agent and distributor.</p>\n\n<h2>Cast</h2>\n<ul><li>Evan Glodell as Woodrow</li>\n<li>Jessie Wiseman as Milly</li>\n<li>Tyler Dawson as Aiden</li>\n<li>Rebekah Brandes as Courtney</li>\n<li>Vincent Grashaw as Mike</li>\n<li>Zack Kraus as Elliot</li>\n<li>Keghan Hurst as Sarah</li>\n<li>Alexandra Boylan as Caitlin</li>\n<li>Jon Huck as himself</li></ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<h2>External links</h2>\n<ul><li><i>Bellflower</i> Official Website</li>\n<li><i>Bellflower</i> Trailers</li>\n<li><i>Bellflower</i> at IMDb</li>\n<li><i>Bellflower</i> at Rotten Tomatoes</li>\n<li><i>Bellflower</i> at SXSW: \"Bellflower and The Art of Promotion\" Yahoo!
