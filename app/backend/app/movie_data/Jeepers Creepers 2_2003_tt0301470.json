Additionally, Francis Ford Coppola returned to the franchise as an executive producer.\nProduced by Myriad Pictures and American Zoetrope, filming for Jeepers Creepers 2 took place in Tejon Ranch, and Long Beach, California in 2002. The film was theatrically released by United Artists in the United States on August 29, 2003, where it was met with mostly negative reviews from critics.

    "wikipedia_plot": "Three days after the events of the first film, the Creeper abducts a young Billy Taggart in front of his father Jack Sr., his older brother Jack Jr. and their dog Mac in its 22nd day of feeding. The next day, a school bus carrying a high school basketball team and cheerleaders suffers a blowout, after one of the tires is hit by a hand-crafted shuriken made of bone fragments. Later a cheerleader named Minxie Hayes has a vision of Billy Taggart and Darry Jenner who attempt to warn her about the Creeper before it blows out another tire and disables the bus. With the team stranded, the Creeper abducts bus driver Betty Borman and coaches Charlie Hanna and Dwayne Barnes. When the Creeper returns, he singles out six of the students: Dante Belasco, Jake Spencer, Minxie Hayes, Scotty Braddock, Andy \"Bucky\" Buck, and Deaundre \"Double D\" Davis. Minxie has another vision in which Darry says the Creeper emerges every 23rd spring for 23 days to eat humans and she tells the other students.\nAfter hearing several police reports, the Taggarts go hunting for the Creeper and soon make radio contact with the school bus. The Creeper attacks Bucky, but Rhonda stabs it through the head with a javelin. Dante begins prodding the Creeper's wing, only for it to grab and decapitate him. The Creeper tears off its injured head and uses Dante's severed head to replace its own. The students decide to leave the bus to find help, but the Creeper returns and chases them into a field, where it kills Jake and takes Scotty.\nWhen the Creeper attacks Jonny, Chelsea, and Bucky on the bus again, the Taggarts and Mac arrive and Jack shoots it with a harpoon, which the Creeper fights him off, managing to escape after flipping over the bus. Rhonda, Izzy Cohen, and Double D find a truck and attempt to escape but are chased by the Creeper again. Izzy pushes Rhonda out of the truck before causing the vehicle to crash, injuring both Double D and the Creeper, who loses an arm, a leg, and a wing, although Izzy crawls from the wreckage before the truck explodes. The Creeper continues to pursue Double D by leaping towards him and, when it has Double D pinned down, Jack shows up and shoots the Creeper in the head with the harpoon. He repeatedly stabs the Creeper in its heart but it goes into a hibernation state before it can die.\n23 years later, 3 teenagers drive out to the Taggart farm where the Creeper is a sideshow attraction called \"A Bat Out of Hell\" and the middle-aged Jack Jr. is charging entrance fees. They see an elderly Jack Sr. watching it with the harpoon at his side and when they ask him if he is waiting for something, he looks up at the Creeper and says \"About three more days, give or take a day or two\".",

Other international takings were between $27.4 and $84.3 million, depending on the source. The worldwide gross was $63.1\u2013120 million, higher than the original. It displaced its predecessor, <i>Jeepers Creepers</i>, to become the new record holder for the highest ever Labor Day opening weekend four-day gross, holding the record until the 2005 release of <i>Transporter 2</i>.  After the 2020 Labor Day weekend, <i>Jeepers Creepers 2</i> still holds the #6 spot with the #8 spot still held by <i>Jeepers Creepers</i>. Allowing for films that had been released prior to Labor Day, <i>Jeepers Creepers 2</i> holds the #9 spot after the 2015 Labor Day four-day weekend.</p><p>On December 23, 2003, MGM released the film on VHS and DVD. It was released on Blu-ray twice as a double feature with the first film, once by Shout! Factory.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n<p>Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 24% of 127 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"<i>Jeepers Creepers 2</i> is competently made, but it doesn't have the scares of the original.\" Metacritic rated it 36/100 based on 29 reviews. Andy Klein of <i>Variety</i> wrote, \"Few things are scarier than a sequel to a bad movie, but, in fact, <i>Jeepers Creepers 2</i> is substantially better than its predecessor, even while staying strictly within the genre's well-defined boundaries.\"  Michael Rechtshaffen of <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> wrote, \"The sequel has got the creepy bits down cold but lacks a fair share of scares.\"  Roger Ebert, writing for <i>The Chicago Sun-Times</i>, rated the film one out of four stars and said, \"Victor Salva's <i>Jeepers Creepers 2</i> supplies us with a first-class creature, a fourth-rate story, and dialogue possibly created by feeding the screenplay into a pasta maker.\"  In <i>The New York Times</i>, Dave Kehr wrote that creature lacks personality when the concept is retooled into a film series.  Gene Seymour of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> wrote that the sequel lacks the mood of the first film, and the teen protagonists are too annoying to draw much of the audience's sympathy.  However, Seymour praised Wise's performance.  In a positive review, Nathan Rabin of <i>The A.V. Club</i> called it \"the rare sequel that's not only bigger than its predecessor, but also better\".</p><p>Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.</p>\n\n<h3>Awards</h3>\n<ul><li>Nomination \u2013 Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films</li>\n<li>Nomination \u2013 Saturn Award Best Horror Film</li>\n<li>Nomination \u2013 Motion Picture Sound Editors: Golden Reel Award Best Sound Editing in a Feature Film (David Bondelevitch and Victor Salva)</li></ul>\n\n<h2>Prequel</h2>\n<p>In September 2015, <i>Jeepers Creepers 3</i> was officially greenlit.
