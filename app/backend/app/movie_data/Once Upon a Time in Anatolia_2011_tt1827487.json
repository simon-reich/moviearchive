    "overview": "In the rural area around the Anatolian town of Keskin, the local prosecutor, police commissar, and doctor lead a search for a victim of a murder to whom a suspect named Kenan and his mentally challenged brother confessed. However, the search is proving more difficult than expected as Kenan is fuzzy as to the body's exact location. As the group continues looking, its members can't help but chat among themselves about both trivia and their deepest concerns in an investigation that is proving more trying than any of them expected.",

    "wikipedia_plot": "A group of men drive around at night in the rural area of Keskin looking for the buried body of murder victim Yasar Toprak. The perpetrator Kenan recalls burying him near a water fountain with his mentally challenged brother, but the fact that he was drunk during it, the lack of sunlight, and the repetitive landscapes make it difficult for him to find. As the night goes on, prosecutor Nurset tells doctor Cemal about a case he was involved in where a woman correctly informed her husband of her date of death months in advance shortly after giving birth to their child. He explains that she died of a heart attack, but Cemal points out that she could have brought it on intentionally with medication.\nCommissioner Naci stops Cemal from giving Kenan a cigarette, claiming he has to earn it. The group stops at a nearby village, where the mayor asks Nurset to get Keskin to help fund a morgue, as his town is mostly populated by the elderly and their children want to see their bodies. The wind causes a power outage and the mayor's daughter brings the group tea, where the beauty of her face by lamplight causes Kenan to shed tears. He explains to Naci that he revealed that Yasar's son Adem was actually his, which caused a fight in which Yasar was killed. Naci gives him a cigarette.\nAs the sun rises, Kenan finds the body and the authorities realize it has been tied. They untie it, but then realize it was bound so it could fit in the trunk of Kenan's car. Having forgotten a body bag, they force it into the trunk of their car. As they return to Keskin, Adem and his mother G\u00fclnaz watch Kenan emerge from the car. Adem hits Kenan in the head with a small stone, causing him to weep.\nIn conversation with Nurset, Cemal notes a specific drug that could have easily been used to induce a heart attack, which Nurset admits he is familiar with due to his father-in-law's heart problems. Nurset muses that the woman may have committed suicide because of her husband's infidelity but waited to do so after the baby was born, and the way he describes the situation implies that the woman was his wife. G\u00fclnaz confirms that the body is Yasar, and an autopsy reveals the presence of dirt in his lungs after she leaves, indicating that he was buried alive. Cemal omits this from the report. As the technician cuts open Yasar's body, Cemal watches the remaining Topraks leave with Yasar's belongings.",

The story is based on real events. One of Ceylan's co-writers was an actual doctor, and, in order to attain his license, had been required to work for two years in the town where the plot is set.\n</p><p>The story in the film is based on very similar events the co-writer experienced during this period. The title of the film references Sergio Leone's film <i>Once Upon a Time in the West</i>, and was something one of the drivers uttered during the actual events. When writing the screenplay, the filmmakers tried to be as realistic as possible, and the main aim was to portray the special atmosphere, which had left a strong impression on the doctor. A number of quotations from stories by Anton Chekhov were incorporated in the script.</p><p>The film was produced through Turkey's Zeyno Film, in co-production with the Bosnian company Production2006 Sarajevo, and the Turkish companies NBC Film, 1000 Volt Post Production, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation, Imaj and Fida Film. Filming took place during eleven weeks around Keskin, a district of the K\u0131r\u0131kkale Province in Central Anatolia. It was shot in the CinemaScope format.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n<p>The film has been met with critical acclaim. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 94% based on 70 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10, while Metacritic gives a weighted average rating of 82 based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".</p><p>Dave Calhoun reviewed the film for <i>Time Out London</i>: \"Ceylan is a sly and daring screen artist of the highest order and should draw wild praise with this new film for challenging both himself and us, the audience, with this lengthy, rigorous and masterly portrait of a night and day in the life of a murder investigation.\" Calhoun compared the film to the director's previous works and noted how it to a lesser extent follows genre conventions: \"Displaying a new interest in words and story (albeit of the most elusive kind), <i>Once Upon A Time in Anatolia</i> feels like a change of direction for Ceylan and may disappoint those who were especially attracted to the urbane melancholia of <i>Uzak</i> and <i>Climates</i>. ... Beyond being chronological, the film follows no obvious storytelling pattern. Things happen when they do and at a natural rhythm. ... Ceylan invites us along for the ride \u2013 but only if we're up for it.\"</p><p>The film received the Cannes Film Festival's second most prestigious award, the Grand Prix, in a shared win with the film <i>The Kid with a Bike</i> by the Dardenne brothers.</p><p>The film was selected as Turkey's official submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but did not make the shortlist.</p><p><i>Sight &amp; Sound</i> listed <i>Once Upon a Time in Anatolia</i> as the 8th best film of 2012.
