    "wikipedia_plot": "Craig Schwartz is an unemployed puppeteer in New York City, in a forlorn marriage with his pet-obsessed wife, Lotte. He finds work as a file clerk for the eccentric Dr. Lester in the Mertin-Flemmer building, on a floor between the 7th and 8th, where the ceiling is very low. He develops an attraction to co-worker Maxine Lund, who does not return his affections. While filing, Craig discovers a small hidden door. He crawls through it into a tunnel and finds himself inside the mind of actor John Malkovich. After about 15 minutes, Craig is ejected, landing on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. He tells Maxine about the door, and she realizes they can sell the experience for profit.\nLotte enters the portal and becomes obsessed, saying that the experience awakens her transgender identity. She and Craig visit Dr. Lester's home, where Lotte finds a room filled with Malkovich memorabilia. Maxine arranges a date with Malkovich while he is inhabited by Lotte, who becomes smitten with Maxine. She reciprocates, but only when Lotte is inside Malkovich; Maxine manipulates him into having sex with her while Lotte is in his mind. Craig, forsaken by both women, locks Lotte in a cage and forces her to set up another tryst with Maxine. He inhabits Malkovich instead and discovers that his puppeteering skills allow him some control over him.\nDisturbed by his loss of control, Malkovich confides in his friend Charlie Sheen and becomes suspicious of Maxine. He follows her to the office, where she and Craig charge customers to use the portal. Entering it, Malkovich finds himself in a world where everyone looks like him and says only \"Malkovich.\" After he is ejected, he demands that Craig close the portal, but Craig refuses. Lotte is freed by her pet chimpanzee and warns Maxine that Craig is inhabiting Malkovich, but Maxine is attracted to Craig's ability to control him.\nLotte confronts Dr. Lester, who reveals that he is, in fact, Captain Mertin; having discovered the portal to a \"vessel body\" in the late 1800s, he erected the Mertin-Flemmer building to conceal it. He has obtained immortality by moving from one body to the next, which becomes \"ripe\" on the host's 44th birthday, allowing him to take possession. If he enters the portal past midnight on that day, he will instead be trapped in the next newborn vessel, helpless inside the new host's mind. Lester and a group of friends plan to occupy Malkovich once he turns 44, and Lotte warns them that Craig has taken control.\nCraig discovers he can occupy Malkovich indefinitely. Inhabiting him over the next eight months, he makes Malkovich into a world-class puppeteer and marries Maxine, who becomes pregnant. On Malkovich's 44th birthday, Lester and Lotte kidnap Maxine. They call to demand that Craig leave Malkovich, threatening to kill Maxine, but he hangs up. In desperation, Lotte attempts to shoot Maxine, who escapes into the portal. Lotte pursues her through Malkovich's subconscious before they are both ejected. Maxine confesses that she kept her unborn child because it was conceived while Lotte was in Malkovich's mind, and the women cement their love for each other.\nCraig, believing Maxine is still in danger, leaves Malkovich's mind, allowing Lester and his friends to enter. Discovering that Maxine has discarded him for Lotte, Craig swears to reenter the portal to take back Malkovich's mind. Seven years later, an elderly Malkovich, now a system, tells Sheen about their plan to extend their lives via the portal, which now leads to the mind of Emily, Maxine's daughter. Craig, who entered the portal too late, is permanently trapped inside Emily, forced to watch Lotte and Maxine live happily together.",

    "wikipedia_critics": "On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on 136 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Smart, funny, and highly original, Being John Malkovich supports its wild premise with skillful direction and a stellar ensemble cast.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 90 out of 100 based on 36 critics reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".The film ranked 441st on Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest films of all time. In his review, Roger Ebert awarded the film a full four stars; he later named it the best film of 1999. His comments of praise included \"Rare is the movie where the last half hour surprises you just as much as the first, and in ways you're not expecting. The movie has ideas enough for half a dozen films, but Jonze and his cast handle them so surely that we never feel hard-pressed; we're enchanted by one development after the next\" and he also felt that \"Either Being John Malkovich gets nominated for best picture, or the members of the Academy need portals into their brains.\" Peter Rainer, writing for New York, commented that \"dazzlingly singular movies aren't often this much fun\" in his review, and Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, called it \"the most excitingly original movie of the year.\"Malkovich's performance in Being John Malkovich is ranked number 90 on Premiere's \"100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time\".",

He wrote the script on spec in 1994 and though it was widely read by production company and film studio executives, all turned it down. Hoping to find a producer, Kaufman sent the script to Francis Ford Coppola, who passed it on to his daughter's then boyfriend Spike Jonze.</p><p>Jonze first read the script in 1996 and had agreed to direct the film by 1997. Jonze took the script to Propaganda Films, which agreed to produce the film in partnership with production company Single Cell Pictures. Single Cell producers Michael Stipe and Sandy Stern pitched the film to numerous studios, including New Line Cinema, who dropped the project after chairman Robert Shaye asked, \"Why the fuck can't it be <i>Being Tom Cruise</i>?\". Jonze recalled that Malkovich asked the same question, and that Malkovich had felt that \"Either the movie's a bomb and it's got not only my name above the title but my name in the title, so I'm fucked that way; or it does well and I'm just forever associated with this character.\" Jonze explained in the same interview that he had not realized how brave Malkovich's performance was.</p><p>With a budget of $10 million, principal photography of <i>Being John Malkovich</i> began on July 20, 1998, and continued through August. Filming took place primarily in Los Angeles; specific locations included the University of Southern California campus and the Observation Bar on board the RMS <i>Queen Mary</i>.</p><p>The puppets were created by Kamela Portuges-Robbins and Images in Motion. Phillip Huber animated the puppets. About Huber's puppetry, Jonze has said he was a full-time puppeteer and controlled his puppets with impressive means, such as using strings and no rods to control them, as well as swinging the puppets on high wires.</p>\n\n<h3>Casting</h3>\n<p>Diaz's make-up artist Gucci Westman described styling Diaz in the role as \"a challenge, to make her look homely.\" The script included minimal physical descriptions of characters, and thus when Diaz took up the role she did not know that \"people weren't going to recognize me.\"</p><p>Cusack read the film's script after he had asked his agent to present him with the \"craziest, most unproduceable script you can find.\" Impressed with the script, he asked his agent to follow its progress and book him an audition, which won him the role.</p><p>Keener cited <i>Being John Malkovich</i> as an instance of her taking up a role based on the director's previous work. She had heard about Jonze's experience with music videos and took up the part of Maxine although she initially disliked the character and did not feel that she was right for the part. She was subsequently nominated for an Oscar.\n</p><p>Kaufman said that there was never another actor in Malkovich's place in the script: \"The screenplay was always \"Being John Malkovich\", even before I had any expectation that John Malkovich would even read the script.\" He chose Malkovich because he believed there to be \"an enigmatic quality about him that works\", though Malkovich was partly chosen because of the sound of his name in repetition. Kaufman explained that \"When we were thinking of alternatives, we found that a lot of them weren't fun to say.\" Jonze's then-father-in-law Francis Ford Coppola was able to contact Malkovich, and Jonze flew with producer Sandy Stern to Malkovich's home in France. Stern said that Malkovich was \"half intrigued and half horrified\" when he first read the script, but he eventually agreed to star in the film.</p>\n\n<h2>Release</h2>\n<h3>Theatrical release and box office</h3>\n<p><i>Being John Malkovich</i> was given limited release in the United States theatres on October 22, 1999 and opened across 25 screens.

In his review, Roger Ebert awarded the film a full four stars; he later named it the best film of 1999. His comments of praise included \"Rare is the movie where the last half hour surprises you just as much as the first, and in ways you're not expecting. The movie has ideas enough for half a dozen films, but Jonze and his cast handle them so surely that we never feel hard-pressed; we're enchanted by one development after the next\" and he also felt that \"Either <i>Being John Malkovich</i> gets nominated for best picture, or the members of the Academy need portals into their brains.\" Peter Rainer, writing for <i>New York</i>, commented that \"dazzlingly singular movies aren't often this much fun\" in his review, and Owen Gleiberman, writing for <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, called it \"the most excitingly original movie of the year.\"</p><p>Malkovich's performance in <i>Being John Malkovich</i> is ranked number 90 on <i>Premiere's</i> \"100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time\".</p>\n\n<h3>Accolades</h3>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1011085734\">\n\n<h2>External links</h2>\n\n<ul><li><i>Being John Malkovich</i> at IMDb</li>\n<li><i>Being John Malkovich</i> at AllMovie</li>\n<li><i>Being John Malkovich</i> at Rotten Tomatoes</li>\n<li><i>Being John Malkovich</i> at Metacritic </li>\n<li><i>Being John Malkovich</i> at Box Office Mojo</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw\u2010api\u2010ext.eqiad.main\u2010866c865866\u2010jx6st\nCached time: 20231203072247\nCache expiry: 3600\nReduced expiry: true\nComplications: [vary\u2010revision\u2010sha1, show\u2010toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.790 seconds\nReal time usage: 1.056 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6281/1000000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 275513/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 54929/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 24/100\nExpensive parser function count: 7/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 1/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 222327/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.444/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 9361209/52428800 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%  882.503      1 -total\n 34.81%  307.238      2 Template:Reflist\n 17.98%  158.703     43 Template:Cite_web\n 17.64%  155.640      2 Template:Infobox\n 13.23%  116.731      1 Template:Infobox_film\n  9.83%   86.775      7 Template:Cite_news\n  9.62%   84.926      1 Template:Infobox_album\n  8.10%   71.492      1 Template:IMDb_title\n  6.52%   57.500      7 Template:Navbox\n  6.45%   56.920      1 Template:Short_description\n-->"
