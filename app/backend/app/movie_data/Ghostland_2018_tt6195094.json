The film was predominantly shot in Canada.</p>\n\n<h3>Accident</h3>\n<p>In December 2016, actress Taylor Hickson was facially disfigured while shooting a scene for the film. She was rushed to the hospital and received 70 stitches, but was permanently scarred. In March 2018, Hickson sued the film's production company Incident Productions over lost work as a result of the incident. Hickson claimed in the lawsuit that \"in the course of shooting the scene, the director Pascal Laugier, consistently told Hickson to pound harder on the glass with her fists\". While filming another take, the lawsuit states:\n</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>The glass shattered, causing [her] head and upper body to fall through the door and shards of glass. As a result of the incident, [she] badly cut the left side of her face.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hickson, in the lawsuit, states that the company failed to take \"any and all reasonable steps to ensure that industry standards and practices were adhered to, including but not limited to the use of safety glass and/or stunt doubles as appropriate.\"</p><p>Independent of the pending lawsuits, the Winnipeg-based film company Incident Productions, Inc. pled guilty for \"failing to ensure the safety and welfare of a worker under the Workplace Safety and Health Act,\" and was fined $40,000 by the province of Manitoba.</p>\n\n<h2>Release</h2>\n<p><i>Ghostland</i> was first shown in competition on 3 February 2018 at the Festival international du film fantastique de G\u00e9rardmer. <i>Ghostland</i> won three film awards at the festival, including the Grand Prize, Audience Award, and the SyFy Award. The SyFy award was chosen by five bloggers at the festival. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Strauss of <i>T\u00e9l\u00e9rama</i> noted that this was the second French co-production in a row that dominated the awards at the festival with the previous years big winner being <i>Raw</i> by Julia Ducournau. The film received a theatrical release in France on 14 March 2018. In some territories, the film was released as <i>Ghostland</i> and in others as <i>Incident in a Ghostland</i>.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n<p>On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 55%, based on 29 reviews with an average rating of 6/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \"<i>Incident in a Ghost Land</i> may satisfy horror fans in search of a nasty kick, but it's narratively flawed and decidedly not for the squeamish.\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 44 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".</p><p><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> declared the film to be a \"taut\u2014if somewhat corny\u2014slasher flick\" and it was \"neither for the faint of heart nor the sharp of mind\". The review noted the dialogue, finding that \"for [the director's] second film in English after 2012\u2019s <i>The Tall Man</i>, he could have brushed up more on his dialogue, which rings awfully flat.\" Dennis Harvey of <i>Variety</i> declared that <i>Ghostland</i> \"all seems slick, intense, and unpleasant in the same hollow way \"Martyrs\" did, because all the cruelty is so meaningless. Replacing that film's empty pseudo-mysticism are villains for whom Laugier doesn't bother providing any motivation or backstory.\" Simon Abrams of <i>The Village Voice</i> wrote that the film was a \"disturbing and effective critique of misogynist torture porn,\" it \"may sometimes play like a mindlessly gory slasher clone, but Laugier\u2019s tormented girls consistently prove to be stronger than their brutalized bodies.\"</p>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<h2>External links</h2>\n<ul><li><i>Ghostland</i> at IMDb</li>\n<li><i>Ghostland</i> at Box Office Mojo</li></ul>"
