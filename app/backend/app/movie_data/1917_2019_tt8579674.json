    "wikipedia_summary": "1917 is a 2019 British war film directed and produced by Sam Mendes, who co-wrote it with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. Partially inspired by stories told to Mendes by his paternal grandfather Alfred about his service during World War I, the film takes place after the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line during Operation Alberich, and follows two British soldiers, Will Schofield (George MacKay) and Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), in their mission to deliver an important message to call off a doomed offensive attack. Mark Strong, Andrew Scott, Richard Madden, Claire Duburcq, Colin Firth, and Benedict Cumberbatch also star in supporting roles.\nThe project was announced in June 2018, with MacKay and Chapman signing on in October and the rest of the cast joining the following March. Filming took place from April to June 2019 in the UK, with cinematographer Roger Deakins and editor Lee Smith using long takes to have the entire film appear as two continuous shots.\n1917 premiered in the UK on 4 December 2019 and was released theatrically in the United States on 25 December by Universal Pictures and in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2020 by Entertainment One.

Tom Holland was reported to be pushing for a lead role in the film in September 2018 but ultimately was not involved as he was contractually obligated to do reshoots for <i>Chaos Walking</i> in April 2019. In October 2018, Roger Deakins was set to reunite with Mendes as cinematographer. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman entered negotiations to star that same month. Thomas Newman was hired to compose the score in March 2019. That same month, Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Richard Madden, Andrew Scott, Daniel Mays, Adrian Scarborough, Jamie Parker, Nabhaan Rizwan, and Claire Duburcq joined the cast in supporting roles.</p>\n\n<h3>Writing</h3>\n<p>In August 2019, Mendes stated that the film shows \"the story of a messenger who has a message to carry.\" In December 2019, Mendes stated that the writing involved some risk-taking: \"I took a calculated gamble, and I'm pleased I did because of the energy you get just from driving forward (in the narrative), in a war that was fundamentally about paralysis and stasis.\" The ideas for a script, which Mendes wrote with Krysty Wilson-Cairns, came from the story that Mendes's grandfather, Alfred Mendes, a native of Trinidad who was a messenger for the British on the Western Front, had told him.</p>\n\n<h3>Filming</h3>\n<p>Roger Deakins was the cinematographer for the film, reuniting with Mendes for their fourth collaboration, having first worked together on <i>Jarhead</i> in 2005. Filming was accomplished with long takes and elaborately choreographed moving camera shots to give the effect of two continuous takes. Although many media accounts have referred to the story as being told in only one shot, the screen does cut to black one hour and six minutes into the film, when Schofield is knocked unconscious, and fades in upon his regaining consciousness after night has fallen. Mendes explained, \"It was to do with the fact that I wanted the movie to go from afternoon to dusk, and then from night into dawn. I wanted it to be in two movements...I wanted to take it somewhere more like a hallucination. Somewhere more surreal, almost dream-like. And horrifying too\".</p><p><i>1917</i> was the first film to be shot with the Arri Alexa Mini LF digital cinema camera. Deakins wanted to use a camera with a large format image sensor, but thought that the original Alexa LF was too large and heavy to capture the intimate shots he wanted. Arri provided him with a prototype of the Mini LF two months before filming was set to begin, and two more cameras a week before. His lenses were Arri Signature Primes, of which he used three focal lengths: a 40\u00a0mm lens for most of the film, a wider 35\u00a0mm for scenes in the tunnels and bunkers, to emphasise feelings of claustrophobia, and a narrower 47\u00a0mm in the river, \"to lose some of the background\".</p><p>Filming began on 1 April 2019 and continued through June 2019 in Wiltshire, Hankley Common in Surrey and Govan, as well as at Shepperton Studios. Concern was raised about filming on Salisbury Plain by conservationists who felt the production could disturb potentially undiscovered remains, requesting a survey before any set construction began. Some shots required the use of as many as 500 background extras.</p><p>Sections of the film were also shot near Low Force, on the River Tees, Teesdale in June 2019, a reference to river Styx. The production staff had to install signs warning walkers in the area not to be alarmed at the artificial bodies and body parts strewn around the site. For the scenes on the river, the cast and crew were assisted by a local outdoor adventure provider for safety and stunts.</p>\n<p>The filming of the film's climax, called by many the \"Schofield Run\", required extensive pre-production, and took two days to shoot with George MacKay as Schofield running about 300 meters amidst explosions and over 500 extras as soldiers during every take. Crew members on set, including two grips, had to dress as soldiers and pass in front of the lens as the camera pulled back in order to get the \"complex choreography\" of the scene executed properly. On preparing for the scene, MacKay recalled that \"...Sam gave me a lovely note ... He said, as much as there's desperation and it's intense and what he's running to is so serious, there's almost a euphoria to it as well. It's this kind of utter release.\" During the second take, MacKay knocked into two extras as soldiers mid-run and continued to run after doing so, a moment that was not scripted. This take made it into the finished film and MacKay was not seriously injured as a result. MacKay described how they actually worked in the scene, saying \"As soon as the collisions happened, they felt inevitable. There's a grace to the run, but there's also a reality to the fact that he got knocked about on the way.\" It was not until after filming that MacKay saw the impact that the scene would have upon himself and audiences when he saw the completed film on the screen. \"To be honest, I cried...\", said MacKay about the results, \"...I don't usually get that emotional watching something I've been involved in because I'm more objective, but I found it so moving.\" In conclusion, MacKay described the shot as a \"reflection of the entire film\", while going to say that \"It's a very simple journey through massive difficulty, but there's the notion that it has to get done ... It's something that will always be with me.\"</p>\n\n<h3>Music</h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1126788409\"><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1066479718\"><p>The soundtrack album of the film was released on 20 December 2019.

However, the main and supporting characters all appear to be fictional.</p><p>Contrary to the film's depiction, the number of Black soldiers serving directly in the British Army itself was unknown but negligible, as the Black population in Britain at the time remained small. Instead, the majority of Black troops who participated in the British war effort served in their own colonial regiments from Africa and the West Indies. Over 15,000 men from the British West Indies enlisted in the military during the First World War, and by 1915 they were organised into the British West Indies Regiment. The regiment served in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I, including the Sinai and Palestine campaign and the Mesopotamian campaign. Indian Sikhs would also have served in their own regiments as part of the British Indian Army, not as individuals in the ranks of British regiments and corps. By the end of 1915, the Indian infantry formations had been withdrawn from the Western Front and sent to the Middle East.</p><p>The military historian Jeremy Banning was critical of the military tactics portrayed in the film, writing \"It made no sense, as the film depicts, to have some battalions nine miles beyond the former German line and others seemingly unaware of whether this line was manned [...] As for the assault by the Devons, no unit would attack without adequate artillery support\".</p>\n\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul><li>Real time</li>\n<li><i>Dunkirk</i></li>\n<li><i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i></li>\n<li>List of World War I films</li></ul>\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1011085734\">\n\n<h2>External links</h2>\n\n<ul><li><span><span>Official website</span></span> <span typeof=\"mw:File/Frameless\"></span></li>\n<li><i>1917</i> at IMDb\u00a0</li>\n<li><i>1917</i> at AllMovie </li>\n<li><i>1917</i> at Rotten Tomatoes</li></ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1448\nCached time: 20231203213010\nCache expiry: 3600\nReduced expiry: true\nComplications: [vary\u2010revision\u2010sha1, show\u2010toc]\nCPU time usage: 1.144 seconds\nReal time usage: 1.407 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 9215/1000000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 450059/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 98810/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 24/100\nExpensive parser function count: 16/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 1/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 330189/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.670/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 13199264/52428800 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00% 1175.444      1 -total\n 43.80%  514.897      2 Template:Reflist\n 25.74%  302.554     54 Template:Cite_web\n 11.41%  134.087      3 Template:Infobox\n  7.43%   87.286      1 Template:Infobox_film\n  6.42%   75.475     17 Template:Cite_news\n  5.67%   66.628      1 Template:Infobox_album\n  5.56%   65.399      9 Template:Navbox\n  4.88%   57.419      1 Template:Short_description\n  4.20%   49.401      1 Template:Navboxes\n-->"
