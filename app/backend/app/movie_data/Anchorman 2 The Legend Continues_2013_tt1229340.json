    "wikipedia_summary": "Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues is a 2013 American comedy film and the sequel to the 2004 film Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. As with the original film, it is directed by Adam McKay, produced by Judd Apatow, written by McKay and Will Ferrell, and stars Ferrell, Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and Christina Applegate, all reprising their roles from the first film. Harrison Ford, Kristen Wiig, James Marsden, Meagan Good, and Dylan Baker all join the cast.Development for the film began as early as 2008, but Paramount Pictures turned down the proposed sequel. However, in March 2012, Ferrell officially announced the film was in production and filming began in March 2013. Unlike the first film, the film is distributed by Paramount Pictures instead of DreamWorks Pictures. The Legend Continues was released on December 18, 2013. It received generally positive reviews and grossed $173 million worldwide on a $50 million budget.",
    "wikipedia_plot": "In 1979, Ron Burgundy and Veronica Corningstone are married and co-anchors for a prestigious news network in New York City. One day, Mack Tannen, the most famous nightly news anchor in New York, reveals that he is retiring. He promotes Corningstone, making her the first female nightly news anchor in the history of television, and fires Burgundy due to his continuously sloppy performance on air. Burgundy grows jealous of Corningstone's success and storms out of the house, leaving her and their 6-year-old son Walter.\nSix months later, Burgundy is back in San Diego, barely able to hold a job due to depression. After being fired from SeaWorld and botching a suicide attempt, Burgundy accepts a job offered to him by Freddie Shapp with GNN, the world's first 24-hour news network, for the station's official launch. Along with his dog Baxter, he reassembles his friends and news team Champ Kind, Brian Fantana, and Brick Tamland. They are assigned the unpopular late-night timeslot while obnoxious rival anchorman Jack Lime is put in a primetime slot. Meanwhile, Burgundy finds that Corningstone has started dating psychologist Gary.\nAs GNN launches, Burgundy decides to broadcast what the people want to hear, rather than what they need to hear.

Then after that, Will and I are like, 'let's do <i>Anchorman 2</i><span>'</span>... so you're talking like 2 years maybe we'll do it. But we're going to do it, for sure.\" On July 23, 2008, McKay announced that he and Ferrell had begun work on the sequel. Carell and Rudd, both of whom had become major stars since <i>Anchorman</i> was released, agreed to take pay cuts for the movie, as did Ferrell himself. On April 29, 2010, McKay announced that Paramount Pictures had turned down a proposal for the sequel, despite the proposed pay cuts, saying: \"So bummed. Paramount basically passed on <i>Anchorman 2</i>. Even after we cut our budget down. We tried.\"</p><p>In a May 2010 interview, Ferrell spoke about Paramount passing on the film, saying: \"Well, you know, yeah, it's a little peculiar. On the one hand, [we were] being begged to do a sequel for such a long time, and then we finally came up with a concept that we liked, we talked to all the guys, and everyone was up for it. And then to get the reaction we got, yeah, it's slightly puzzling to us. But you know what? It's also their money. They get to do or not do whatever they want. So we\u2019ll see. We\u2019re still going back and forth. Maybe there is a solution. Or, I know in talking to Adam, if it never happens, then it never happens. And that's fine, too. So we\u2019ll just see.\" A year later, in April 2011, Ferrell publicly stated that Paramount, which owns the rights to <i>Anchorman</i>, had decided against the idea of a sequel, stating \"We've run the numbers and it's not a good fit.\" In March 2012, Paramount changed their minds and agreed to make a sequel; on March 28, 2012, Ferrell officially announced the film on <i>Conan</i>, in character as Ron Burgundy. In an interview in April 2012, McKay said that the script was a work in progress, and that the story might include a custody battle and bowling. In a May 2012 interview, he was quoted as saying that nothing was set.</p><p>In May 2012, Will Ferrell confirmed that script writing had begun and that filming would begin around February 2013. By June 2012, parts of the story had solidified, including a move of the location from San Diego to New York, and a focus on the onset of the cable news era in the 1980s.</p>\n\n<h3>Casting</h3>\n<p>In August 2012, Vince Vaughn confirmed that his character, Wes Mantooth, would appear in the film, and hinted at the possible appearance of Wes Mantooth's mother, Dorothy, who was mentioned in the first film. He expressed interest in Angela Lansbury playing the role. On December 19, 2012, it was announced that the film would be released on December 20, 2013. McKay confirmed in February 2013 that actress Kristen Wiig had joined the cast.</p>\n\n<h3>Filming</h3>\n<p>Filming began in March 2013. On March 4, 2013, actor Harrison Ford was spotted on set with Will Ferrell. Some filming took place on St. Simons Island, Georgia starting on April 22, 2013, through May 8, 2013.

That's better than getting back together just to make money.\" Stephen Whitty of the <i>Newark Star-Ledger</i> gave the film two and a half stars out of four, writing, \"Ferrell and director Adam McKay pushed things even further, raunchier and weirder.\"</p><p>Ian Buckwalter of NPR gave the film a positive review, saying, \"Time will tell if this film is as quotable as its predecessor, but for now, <i>Anchorman 2</i> coasts along quite successfully on sheer manic eccentricity.\" A.O. Scott of  <i>The New York Times</i> gave the film a positive review, writing, \"The sheer density of the jokes guarantees a few laughs for every taste ... and the loose, improvisational energy of the performers keeps things lively.\" Claudia Puig of <i>USA Today</i> gave the film three out of four stars, writing, \"The movie cleverly spoofs the 24-hour TV news cycle, as well as sexism and racism in the workplace. Not every scene is equally funny, of course, but most of the comic antics generate laughs.\" Betsy Sharkey of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> gave the film a negative review, writing, \"While I'm glad <i>Anchorman</i> is back \u2013 we need a little levity in this year of heavy films \u2013 I do wish it were better.\" Steven Rea of <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i> gave the film three out of four stars, writing, \"Burgundy and his goofball buddies are faced with dramas and dilemmas that may seem arbitrary and contrived on paper but have an urgent puissance onscreen, as Ferrell and company act their little hearts out. OK, not really.\" Chris Nashawaty of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> gave the film a B, writing, \"Comedy sequels generally follow the law of diminishing returns. If it has a 2\u2014or, classier yet, a II\u2014in the title, the smart money says that it won't be as funny as the original. <i>Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues</i> doesn't defy that axiom, but it's still plenty hilarious in a reheated sort of way.\" Michael Phillips of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> gave the film two and a half stars out of four, writing, \"Maybe if I liked the first <i>Anchorman</i> a little less, I'd like <i>Anchorman 2</i> a little more. Still, I laughed.\"</p><p>Bill Goodykoontz of <i>The Arizona Republic</i> gave the film three out of five stars, writing, \"For almost every aspect of the movie I want to criticize, there is a corresponding defense.\" Soren Anderson of <i>The Seattle Times</i> gave the film three out of four stars, writing, \"It's a pi\u00f1ata at which Ferrell &amp; Co. swing away wildly. They often miss their mark, but when they connect, out fall the laughs in great big bunches.\" Ann Hornaday of <i>The Washington Post</i> gave the film two and a half stars out of four, writing, \"Considering the improvisatory talents \u2013 even genius \u2013 of Ferrell and his co-stars, it's no surprise that laughs abound in <i>Anchorman 2</i>.\" Peter Travers of <i>Rolling Stone</i> gave the film three out of four stars, writing, \"When is a movie fall-down funny even when some scenes fall flat on their fat ones? When it's <i>Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues</i>.\" James Berardinelli of <i>ReelViews</i> gave the film two and a half stars out of four, commenting, \"At two hours, <i>Anchorman 2</i> overstays its welcome by at least 20 minutes, if not longer.\" Ty Burr of <i>The Boston Globe</i> gave the film a positive review, writing, \"See it with a crowd, laugh yourself silly, and feel slightly ashamed in the morning.\" Scott Foundas of <i>Variety</i> gave the film a positive review, writing, \"A modestly less quotable but generously funny new adventure for scotch-and-mahogany-loving 1970s newsman Ron Burgundy, here catapulted into 1980 and the dawn of the 24-hour news cycle.\" Rafer Guzman of <i>Newsday</i> gave the film a positive review, writing, \"This sequel may not produce any quotable lines, but to borrow one from the original: Don't act like you're not impressed.\"</p>\n\n<h3>Reaction to film's portrayal of news sponsors</h3>\n<p>The film's suggestion that sponsors of news programs have influenced news stories is believed by many to be accurate. After attending a screening of the movie, former WCCO-TV anchorman Don Shelby stated in an op-ed that the film \"hits home\". Advising readers to see it, he wrote \"Comedy is tragedy told with a laugh. For the old-time news people watching, 'Anchorman 2' is pure tragedy because it is essentially the truth ... go home and ask whether what passes as journalism today really is journalism\".</p>\n\n<h2>Possible sequel</h2>\n<p><span id=\"Sequel\"></span><span id=\"Sequels\"></span>\nOn November 13, 2013, Will Ferrell spoke about the possibility of a third <i>Anchorman</i> film, stating: \"I'm sure they would, but I don't know. We just want to see what happens with this one and we'll sit down and assess all of that. Right now, we're just enjoying this journey.\" On December 9, 2013, Steve Carell said, \"We'll see how this one goes\", and \"If people like it, maybe 10 years from now we'll do a third.\"</p><p>Director Adam McKay spoke to <i>Empire</i> in February 2014 and ruled out any further <i>Anchorman</i> films, saying, \"It's done. I think that's it. It was great to do it and it was so fun to work with those guys again, but I think that's it for Ron Burgundy.\", and when asked if he would do sequels with any character he said, \"No, that's the last sequel we're gonna do. There's nothing more fun to me than new characters and a new world. And now we're releasing this alt version, we're totally satisfied. No <i>Anchorman 3</i>.\"</p><p>However, on April 2, 2014, McKay stated that <i>Anchorman 3</i> could still be a possibility. In an interview with <i>Time</i>, he stated, \"I said about a month ago that we'd never do a third one, and I realized that was a little too harsh because the truth is, I really don't know. With these movies, you really don't know how they've played until about two years after they come out, when people see them on repeat viewing.\" He then also went on to state that \"If <i>Anchorman 2</i> gets that sort of second life, if three, four years from now people start asking us that question a lot and there's an idea, we would be open to that.\"</p><p>On March 1, 2018, Adam McKay said that the third film could be having to do with the Iraq War. McKay said, \"I can give you like a little half sentence. I don\u2019t know if you remember the first and even the second Iraq war. Maybe it was mainly the second Iraq war. They embedded journalists and that gave us kind of a whole story idea\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say too much, but I\u2019ll just tell you that embedded journalist, Ron Burgundy, Veronica Corningstone, the news team. That definitely gave us a big idea.\"</p>\n\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul><li>List of media set in San Diego</li></ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<h2>External links</h2>\n\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1134653256\">\n<ul><li><i>Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues</i> at IMDb</li>\n<li><i>Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues</i> at the TCM Movie Database</li>\n<li><i>Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues</i> at Rotten Tomatoes</li>\n<li><i>Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues</i> at Metacritic </li>\n<li><i>Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues</i> at AllMovie</li>\n<li><i>Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues</i> at Box Office Mojo</li></ul>"
