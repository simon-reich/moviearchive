    "wikipedia_plot": "A contagious disease ravages the planet. A couple, Paul and Sarah, and their teenage son Travis are secluded in their home deep in the woods in an undisclosed location. After Sarah's father, Bud, contracts the disease, they kill him and burn his body.\nThat night, they capture an intruder breaking in. Paul ties him to a tree and places a bag over his head overnight to confirm he is not suffering from the disease. The stranger, Will, explains he was searching for fresh water for his wife and his young son. Will offers to trade some food for water. Sarah suggests taking the strangers in, reasoning the more people, the easier it would be to defend themselves. Paul reluctantly agrees, and drives Will to collect his family. Along the way, they are ambushed by two men. Paul kills them, while accusing Will of setting him up. Will assuages Paul's mistrust.\nPaul returns with Will, his wife Kim, and son Andrew. After establishing their rules, which include keeping the only entrance locked with a key Paul or Sarah wear around their neck, the two families establish a sense of normality, and grow closer.\nOne day, Travis's dog Stanley begins barking aggressively at an unseen presence and chases it into the woods. Travis, who had followed Stanley, insists he heard something in the woods. That night, Will seemingly contradicts a story he told Paul earlier, resulting in Paul's increasing distrust of Will.\nThat evening, Travis discovers Andrew sleeping on the floor of Bud's old room suffering from a nightmare. He also finds the front door of the house open. The families investigate, finding a bleeding and gravely sick Stanley on the floor. They kill and burn the dog. After Travis reveals the door was open, Sarah suggests sleepwalking Andrew opened the door, causing more distrust. Paul suspects Andrew is infected, and decides they should quarantine in their separate rooms to ensure no one is sick.

He cites Pieter Bruegel the Elder\u2019s 1562 oil painting <i>The Triumph of Death</i> as inspiration and it features prominently in the movie and its first trailer. Although the film is post-apocalyptic Shults did not look to any other such films as inspiration; instead, he cited the work of Paul Thomas Anderson and John Cassavetes and the films <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> and <i>The Shining</i> as inspirations. To the later point, the film takes some influences from <i>The Shining</i><span>'</span>s Overlook Hotel in that the layout of the house is deliberately vague and never properly established. Shults has described it \"as this kind of labyrinth\" and a metaphor for \"the mesh of Travis' head\".</p><p>In June 2016, Joel Edgerton joined the cast of the film.
