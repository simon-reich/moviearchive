He learns his lines by listening to tapes recorded by Oto, while driving his red Saab 900 Turbo. After Y\u016bsuke performs in Waiting for Godot, Oto introduces him to young television star K\u014dji Takatsuki. Y\u016bsuke returns home early one day and finds his wife having sex with K\u014dji, but does not disturb them. After a car crash, Y\u016bsuke discovers he has glaucoma in one eye and must take eyedrops to prevent blindness. One day, Oto asks to have a serious conversation with Y\u016bsuke. After he spends the day driving alone, Y\u016bsuke returns home to find Oto dead from a brain hemorrhage. After the funeral, Y\u016bsuke breaks down while performing the title role in Uncle Vanya.\nTwo years later, Y\u016bsuke accepts a residency in Hiroshima to direct a multilingual production of Uncle Vanya. The theatre festival requires that he be chauffeured in his own car for insurance reasons, and he eventually bonds with his reserved young driver, Misaki Watari. With the help of dramaturge Gong Yoon-su, Y\u016bsuke casts a diverse group of actors to perform in their native languages. He is impressed by Lee Yoo-na, a mute actress who communicates in Korean Sign Language, and he also unexpectedly casts K\u014dji as Uncle Vanya.\nAfter a rehearsal, K\u014dji invites Y\u016bsuke for a drink, where the young actor pushes against harsh assessments of his character but admits to his unrequited love for Oto. He scolds someone for taking a photo of him. Yoon-su invites Y\u016bsuke and Misaki to dinner with his wife, who is revealed to be Yoo-na. Driving home, Misaki tells Y\u016bsuke about driving her abusive mother for long hours at a young age. They later visit a garbage facility, where Misaki explains that she drove garbage trucks after leaving her hometown when a landslide destroyed her home and killed her mother.\nDrinking with K\u014dji again, Y\u016bsuke reveals that he thinks he can no longer play Vanya himself, and suggests that K\u014dji's lack of self-control is a personal weakness but a strength as an actor. After K\u014dji slips away to confront a man taking photos of him, Misaki drives them home. Y\u016bsuke reveals that he and Oto lost their young daughter, who would now be Misaki's age; Oto's gift for telling stories after sex was a bond that helped them both cope. Though he knew of his wife's affairs, Y\u016bsuke believes she still loved him, and K\u014dji shares one of Oto's stories that Y\u016bsuke never heard in its entirety.\nThe police interrupt a rehearsal and arrest K\u014dji, as the man he attacked has died from his injuries. Given two days to consider whether to take over as Vanya or else cancel the production, Y\u016bsuke asks Misaki to take him to her childhood home in Hokkaido. Y\u016bsuke shares his guilt for not coming home to face the discussion Oto wanted to have, which might have allowed him to save her life. Misaki reveals that she escaped the landslide but chose not to pull her mother from the wreckage, receiving a scar on her cheek she has chosen not to have treated. They visit the snowy remains of Misaki's childhood home and hug as they both confront their shared grief.\nY\u016bsuke assumes the role of Vanya and gives an impassioned performance before a live audience, including Misaki.

They later visit a garbage facility, where Misaki explains that she drove garbage trucks after leaving her hometown when a landslide destroyed her home and killed her mother.\n</p><p>Drinking with K\u014dji again, Y\u016bsuke reveals that he thinks he can no longer play Vanya himself, and suggests that K\u014dji's lack of self-control is a personal weakness but a strength as an actor. After K\u014dji slips away to confront a man taking photos of him, Misaki drives them home. Y\u016bsuke reveals that he and Oto lost their young daughter, who would now be Misaki's age; Oto's gift for telling stories after sex was a bond that helped them both cope. Though he knew of his wife's affairs, Y\u016bsuke believes she still loved him, and K\u014dji shares one of Oto's stories that Y\u016bsuke never heard in its entirety.\n</p><p>The police interrupt a rehearsal and arrest K\u014dji, as the man he attacked has died from his injuries. Given two days to consider whether to take over as Vanya or else cancel the production, Y\u016bsuke asks Misaki to take him to her childhood home in Hokkaido. Y\u016bsuke shares his guilt for not coming home to face the discussion Oto wanted to have, which might have allowed him to save her life. Misaki reveals that she escaped the landslide but chose not to pull her mother from the wreckage, receiving a scar on her cheek she has chosen not to have treated. They visit the snowy remains of Misaki's childhood home and hug as they both confront their shared grief.\n</p><p>Y\u016bsuke assumes the role of Vanya and gives an impassioned performance before a live audience, including Misaki. Yoo-na meaningfully delivers Sonya's final lines: \"We shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all in diamonds, we shall see how all earthly evil, all our sufferings, are drowned in the mercy that will fill the whole world. And our life will grow peaceful, tender, sweet as a caress\u2026 You've had no joy in your life; but wait, Uncle Vanya, wait\u2026 We shall rest.\" Actors and audience alike are moved by the performance. Some time later, Misaki is living in Korea. Buying groceries, she returns to Y\u016bsuke's red Saab, in which a dog rests. She takes off her surgical mask, revealing that her scar is now barely visible, and drives away.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Cast</h2>\n<ul><li>Hidetoshi Nishijima as Y\u016bsuke Kafuku</li>\n<li>T\u014dko Miura as Misaki Watari</li>\n<li>Reika Kirishima as Oto Kafuku, Yusuke's wife</li>\n<li>Park Yu-rim as Lee Yoo-na</li>\n<li>Jin Dae-yeon as Gong Yoon-soo</li>\n<li>Sonia Yuan as Janice Chang</li>\n<li>Ahn Hwitae as Ryu Jeong-eui</li>\n<li>Perry Dizon as Roy Lucelo</li>\n<li>Satoko Abe as Yuhara</li>\n<li>Masaki Okada as K\u014dji Takatsuki</li></ul>\n\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>The film is directed by Ryusuke Hamaguchi. The film was originally set in Busan, South Korea, but was changed to Hiroshima due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<h3>Writing</h3>\n<p>Hamaguchi was the co-writer of the filmscript with Takamasa Oe. It is primarily based on \"Drive My Car\" by Haruki Murakami from his 2014 short story collection, <i>Men Without Women</i>. The script also features elements from Murakami's stories \"Scheherazade\" and \"Kino\" (both also part of <i>Men Without Women</i>). For the film version, the co-authors were reported by <i>The New York Times</i> to have \"greatly expanded on the (short) story's central dynamic, which turns on a sexist widowed actor and the much-younger female driver who motors him around in his cherished Saab.\"</p>\n\n<h3>Cinematography</h3>\n<p>Cinematographer Hidetoshi Shinomiya was assigned to do the filming for the project.</p>\n\n<h3>Set design</h3>\n<p>The original story features a yellow Saab 900 convertible, but it was changed in the film to a red Saab 900 Turbo to visually complement the Hiroshima landscape.</p>\n\n<h2>Soundtrack</h2>\n<p>Hamaguchi wished to incorporate the Beatles' song \"Drive My Car\", which the film and story are named after.  However, it was too difficult to get permission for its usage.

In an interview with <i>Variety</i>, director Hamaguchi said; \"Typically, I don't use a lot of music in my films, but hearing the music Ishibashi made was the first time I thought this could work for the film.\" The soundtrack consists of 12 tracks.</p>\n\n<h3>Music personnel</h3>\n<ul><li>Eiko Ishibashi\u00a0: Piano, Rhodes, Synth, Flutes, Electronics, Melodion, Vibraphone</li>\n<li>Jim O'Rourke\u00a0: A.Guitar, E.Guitar, Pedal Steel, Guitar, Bass, Vibraphone</li>\n<li>Tatsuhisa Yamamoto\u00a0: Drums, Percussion</li>\n<li>Marty Holoubek\u00a0: A.Bass, E.Bass (Track 1,2,4,8)</li>\n<li>Toshiaki Sudoh\u00a0: E.
