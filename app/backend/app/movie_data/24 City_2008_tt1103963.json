The film follows three generations of characters in Chengdu (in the 1950s, the 1970s and the present) as a state-owned factory gives way to a modern apartment complex. The film was also known as <i>The Story of 24 City</i> during production.</p>\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\">\n\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>The apartment complex featured in the film is an actual development (also called \"24 City\") built on the former site of an airplane engine manufacturing facility. Jia will also produce a documentary about the location.</p><p>The film's narrative style is described by critics as a blend of fictive and documentary story-telling, and it consists of authentic interviews and fictive scenes delivered by actors (but presented in a documentary format).</p>\n\n<h2>Release</h2>\n<p><i>24 City</i> made its debut shown in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.  <i>Film Comment</i>, the official journal of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, listed the film at the end of 2008 as the second-best unreleased (without U.S. theatrical release) film of the year.</p>\n\n<h3>Reception</h3>\n<p>On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 89% approval rating based on 44 reviews, with an average score of 7.4/10. The consensus reads, \"One of China's most talented directors blurs the lines between non-fiction, drama, and musical theater in this vivid portrait of a country in cultural flux.\" On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 75 out of 100, based on 11 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".</p><p><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> called the film a \"moving elegy to modern-day China\" and said of the film's documentary strain that it \"prevails to simple, yet emotionally reverberating effect\".</p><p><i>Time</i> also reviewed the film favorably: \"the film interweaves the political overview \u2014 of a city institution being torn down to be replaced by commercial and residential buildings \u2014 with personal anecdotes that are poignant and charming.\"</p><p><i>Screen International</i> states \"the latest chapter in Jia Zhangke's chronicles of modern Chinese history is certain to reinforce the director's status as an international arthouse icon.\"</p><p><i>The New York Times</i> film critic Manohla Dargis gave the film a rave and stated \"...the often amazing and intricately structured '24 City,' the latest from the Chinese director Jia Zhang-ke...shot in digital so sharp it looks hyper-real and projected digitally, the movie takes as its point of departure the closing of a state-owned munitions factory in southwest China... Mr. Jia is one of the most original filmmakers working today, creating movies about a country that seems like a sequel.\"</p><p>Anthony Kaufman of <i>IndieWire</i> praised the film and states \"Jia's masterful aesthetic remains consistent, mixing documentary and fiction with intriguing results.\"</p><p>J. Hoberman of the <i>Village Voice</i> described the film as \"so meaningfully framed that it could have been shot by Andy Warhol or Chantal Akerman\", and called the film as one of the stand-outs of this year's films in competition at the Cannes Film Festival.</p>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<h2>External links</h2>\n<ul><li><i>24 City</i> at IMDb</li>\n<li><i>24 City</i> at AllMovie</li>\n<li><i>24 City</i> at 2008 Cannes Film Festival</li>\n<li><i>24 City</i> at the Chinese Movie Database</li>\n<li><i>24 City</i> at Rotten Tomatoes</li></ul>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1492\nCached time: 20231203064532\nCache expiry: 3600\nReduced expiry: true\nComplications: [vary\u2010revision\u2010sha1, show\u2010toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.407 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.539 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 2655/1000000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 57102/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 5111/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 24/100\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 1/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 51360/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.276/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 25977680/52428800 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%  502.663      1 -total\n 62.04%  311.873      3 Template:Infobox\n 36.93%  185.649      1 Template:Infobox_film\n 24.79%  124.586      1 Template:Infobox_Chinese/Chinese\n 24.59%  123.625      1 Template:Reflist\n 19.57%   98.358      2 Template:Lang\n 16.38%   82.335      8 Template:Cite_web\n 13.19%   66.277      1 Template:Jia_Zhangke\n 12.81%   64.398      1 Template:Navbox\n  9.56%   48.031      1 Template:Short_description\n-->"
