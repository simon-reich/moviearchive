    "wikipedia_critics": "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 39% based on 278 reviews, and an average rating of 5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Halloween Kills should satisfy fans in search of brute slasher thrills, but in terms of advancing the franchise, it's a bit less than the sum of its bloody parts.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale, lower than the \"B+\" earned by its 2018 predecessor, while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 69% positive score, with 52% saying they would definitely recommend it.Barry Hertz of The Globe and Mail was positive in his review, saying that the film was \"brimming with odd decisions\", but added: \"there is something entertaining, or maybe just enjoyably puzzling, about what Gordon Green and McBride think a Michael Myers movie could or ought to be.\" Reviewing the film for TheWrap, Asher Luberto praised the return of cast members from the 1978 film and wrote: \"Green seems less interested in rewriting the Halloween playbook than in giving audiences what they came for, from ghastly scares to a ghoulish score. It's a strategy that promises to make the series as immortal as Michael Myers himself.\" /Film's Marshall Shaffer gave the film 7.5/10 and said: \"There's good reason to be excited for how Green will bring this all to a head in his grand finale. Halloween Kills manages to put a playful but petrifying spin on mythology without resorting to cheap self-referentiality.\" Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film 2.5/4 stars, saying that it was \"gruesomely brutal as a night spent with Michael Myers should be\", but added that it \"loses some of its skull-crushing effectiveness juggling rampant carnage and social commentary.\"Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: \"Halloween night may be Michael Myers' masterpiece, but Halloween Kills is no masterpiece. It's a mess \u2014 a slasher movie that's almost never scary, slathered with 'topical' pablum and with too many parallel plot strands that don't go anywhere.\" Kyle Smith of National Review criticized the violence in the film, writing: \"the only element that excites more than it nauseates is the terrific score\", and called the film \"grueling, enervating, and dispiriting\". David Fear of Rolling Stone wrote: \"Kills comes incredibly close to erasing every ounce of good will that Green's revolutionary redo built up. It murders the desire to ever watch another Halloween movie again.\" Brian Lowry of CNN said that the film was \"odd on various levels, starting with the wholly misguided attempt to weave a half-baked message into its bloody mayhem\", and wrote: \"If the previous movie conjured a bit of excitement by eradicating everything that had transpired after the original, that sense of novelty has quickly worn off.\"Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a score of 2/4 stars, describing it as a \"thudding disappointment\" and \"an inconsistent, sloppy mess.\" Kevin Maher of The Times gave the film 1/5 stars, describing it as a \"depressingly mechanical gorefest\" that \"has nothing to offer the sentient viewer\". Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent gave the film 2/5 stars, describing it as a \"lurching, directionless corpse of a film\" that \"relies far too much on the knowledge that it has one more instalment \u2026 in which to figure out what the whole blasted trilogy should be about.\" Linda Marric of The Jewish Chronicle also gave the film 2/5 stars, deeming it \"a shambolic, risible mess which is further hampered by a total absence of genuinely scary bits.\" Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph also gave the film 2/5 stars, writing: \"Halloween Kills certainly feels like more Halloween. But the game board is left exactly as it was found in readiness for round 13; the only thing that advances is the body count.\" However, Aedan Juvet of Bleeding Cool referred to the film as a \"worthwhile middle chapter of a trilogy.\"",

Then we were like, 'Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. This could come out, and everyone could hate us, and we'd never work again. So, let's not have to sit around for a year while we wait for another movie to come out that we know people aren't going to like.' So, we were like, 'Let's learn from this, and see what works, and what doesn't.' But we definitely have an idea of where we would go [with] this branch of the story and hopefully we get a chance to do it.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>In September 2018, producer Jason Blum said that \"we will do a sequel if the movie performs\". By October 2018, after the film's opening weekend, McBride confirmed that early development on a sequel had begun. In February 2019, <i>Collider</i> exclusively confirmed Scott Teems was in talks to write the script, having collaborated with Blumhouse Productions on several projects in development. Teems had also written a story treatment for the film prior to the negotiations. Blum, Malek Akkad and Bill Block returned as producers, while Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer and Andi Matichak reprised their roles.</p>\n\n<h3>Pre-production</h3>\n<p>In June 2019, it was reported that a sequel would begin filming in September 2019, with Green returning to write the script and direct and Curtis, Greer, and Matichak reprising their roles from the 2018 film. On July 8, 2019, <i>Bloody Disgusting</i> reported that the studio was not only considering filming two sequels back to back, but also releasing both of them in October 2020. Green had worked with McBride and co-writer Jeff Fradley to map out two films before realizing they had enough material to make a trilogy. On July 19, 2019, Universal Pictures revealed the titles and release dates of two sequels were announced: <i>Halloween Kills</i>, set to be released on October 16, 2020, and <i>Halloween Ends</i>, set to be released on October 15, 2021. Green would direct both films and co-write the scripts with McBride, and Curtis would reprise her role in both films.

On August 26, 2019, it was announced that Anthony Michael Hall would join the cast as Tommy Doyle, a character portrayed by Brian Andrews in the original <i>Halloween</i> film. Paul Rudd, who played Doyle in <i>Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers</i>, was approached to reprise his role, but declined as he was unavailable due to his commitments to <i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i>.</p><p>On August 30, 2019, it was announced that Kyle Richards would reprise her role as Lindsey Wallace from the original film.

On September 27, 2019, Nancy Stephens, who portrayed Nurse Marion Chambers in the original film and its sequels <i>Halloween II</i> and <i>Halloween H20: 20 Years Later</i>, was confirmed to be reprising her role. Jibrail Nantambu is set to reprise his role as Julian from the previous film; while Victoria Paige Watkins and Brian F. Durkin were confirmed as members of the cast. In May 2021, it was revealed that Thomas Mann would appear in an undisclosed role.</p>\n\n<h3>Filming</h3>\n<p>On July 19, 2019, a spokesperson for Blumhouse Productions confirmed that <i>Halloween Kills</i> and its sequel <i>Halloween Ends</i> will commence production and filming in Wilmington, North Carolina at the same time. The movie commenced filming September 16, 2019. According to a film permit obtained from the city, there would be a news reporter scene giving updates on the events of the 2018 film. Filming in Wilmington on September 20 to 21 involved a car wreck scene. Actress Kyle Richards broke her nose whilst filming an action sequence with Michael Myers. Richards kept the incident to herself as to not be replaced by a stunt double. Additional photography included simulated gunfire scenes on September 27, September 30, and October 1. Additional filming occurred on October 16, 2019. Curtis began filming her scenes on October 7 and wrapped them by October 19. Filming concluded on November 3, 2019. The final confrontation where Michael murders the mob formed by Tommy Doyle was filmed on a \"lazy susan\"-esque rotating stage that circled around the camera.</p><p>In an interview, Andi Matichak revealed that filming was planned back-to-back with <i>Halloween Ends</i> but did not occur due to the \"intense schedule\".</p>\n\n<h3>Music</h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>John Carpenter, Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies, returned to score for <i>Halloween Kills</i>, after previously scoring for <i>Halloween</i> (2018). Much of the film's score has been completed before the COVID-19 pandemic. The album was released in iTunes on October 14, 2021, and in all digital platforms on October 15. Sacred Bones Records published the soundtrack in CD, vinyl edition and cassettes. It was led by three singles: \"Unkillable\", \"Rampage\" and \"Michael's Legend\", and an end-credits song performed by the Swedish rock band Ghost, \"Hunter's Moon\" was also released as a single, but not included in the soundtrack. The album debuted at number 9 in <i>Billboard</i> Top Album Sales for the week beginning October 23.</p>\n\n<h2>Release</h2>\n<p><i>Halloween Kills</i> premiered at the 78th Venice International Film Festival on September 8, 2021. The film was originally set to be theatrically released on October 16, 2020, but in July 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was delayed to October 15, 2021. On September 9, 2021, it was announced that in addition to being released in theaters the film would also be streamed on paid tiers of Peacock for 60 days. The film, along with the extended cut, was released on HBO Max on March 18, 2022.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Extended Cut</h3>\n<p>An extended version of the film, simply titled <i>The Extended Cut</i>, was released on iTunes on December 14, 2021, in the United States and Canada, and on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on January 11, 2022. This version of the film was announced by director David Gordon Green upon the theatrical release of the film, and contains \"more thrills, more kills, and an alternate ending\". Green told <i>Collider</i>, \"This is the director's cut through and through, but there's an additional scene that we filmed that was scripted. [...] We ended up lifting it when I became more confident of where we're going to pick up in the next movie [<i>Ends</i>], it felt it didn't feel authentic to where we're going to go. So we lifted it.\", referring to the ending scene where Michael suddenly kills Karen. The alternate ending involves Laurie attempting to call Karen - initially unaware of what just happened - only for Michael to pick up and, upon hearing his breathing on the phone and knowing Karen is dead, warns that she is coming for him. She then takes the knife from her bedside and leaves the hospital determined to find him. The ending would have suggested the sequel would take place the same night as <i>Kills</i> (in 2018), instead of in 2022 as revealed later by Green. The extended cut, along with the theatrical cut, was released on HBO Max on March 18, 2022.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n<h3>Audience viewership</h3>\n<p>According to Samba TV, the film was watched in 2.8 million households in its first 30 days on Peacock.</p>\n\n<h3>Box office</h3>\n<p><i>Halloween Kills</i> grossed $92 million in the United States and Canada, and $41.4 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $133.4 million.</p><p>In the United States and Canada, <i>Halloween Kills</i> was released alongside <i>The Last Duel</i>, and was initially projected to gross $35\u201340 million from 3,700 theaters in its opening weekend.

After making $22.8 million on its first day (including previews), which also immediately surpassed the lifetime totals of <i>Halloween III</i>, <i>4</i>, <i>5</i>, and <i>Curse of Michael Myers</i>, estimates were raised to $50 million. It went on to debut to $49.4 million, topping the box office and marking the best opening for an R-rated film amid the pandemic (nearly doubling <i>The Suicide Squad</i><span>'</span>s $26.2 million), though the record was later broken by <i>John Wick: Chapter 4</i> which opened to $73.5 million in March 2023.

The site's critical consensus reads, \"<i>Halloween Kills</i> should satisfy fans in search of brute slasher thrills, but in terms of advancing the franchise, it's a bit less than the sum of its bloody parts.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale, lower than the \"B+\" earned by its 2018 predecessor, while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 69% positive score, with 52% saying they would definitely recommend it.</p><p>Barry Hertz of <i>The Globe and Mail</i> was positive in his review, saying that the film was \"brimming with odd decisions\", but added: \"there is something entertaining, or maybe just enjoyably puzzling, about what Gordon Green and McBride think a Michael Myers movie could or ought to be.\" Reviewing the film for <i>TheWrap</i>, Asher Luberto praised the return of cast members from the 1978 film and wrote: \"Green seems less interested in rewriting the <i>Halloween</i> playbook than in giving audiences what they came for, from ghastly scares to a ghoulish score. It's a strategy that promises to make the series as immortal as Michael Myers himself.\" <i>/Film</i><span>'</span>s Marshall Shaffer gave the film 7.5/10 and said: \"There's good reason to be excited for how Green will bring this all to a head in his grand finale. <i>Halloween Kills</i> manages to put a playful but petrifying spin on mythology without resorting to cheap self-referentiality.\" Brian Truitt of <i>USA Today</i> gave the film 2.5/4 stars, saying that it was \"gruesomely brutal as a night spent with Michael Myers should be\", but added that it \"loses some of its skull-crushing effectiveness juggling rampant carnage and social commentary.\"</p><p>Owen Gleiberman of <i>Variety</i> wrote: \"Halloween night may be Michael Myers' masterpiece, but <i>Halloween Kills</i> is no masterpiece. It's a mess \u2014 a slasher movie that's almost never scary, slathered with 'topical' pablum and with too many parallel plot strands that don't go anywhere.\" Kyle Smith of <i>National Review</i> criticized the violence in the film, writing: \"the only element that excites more than it nauseates is the terrific score\", and called the film \"grueling, enervating, and dispiriting\". David Fear of <i>Rolling Stone</i> wrote: \"<i>Kills</i> comes incredibly close to erasing every ounce of good will that Green's revolutionary redo built up. It murders the desire to ever watch another <i>Halloween</i> movie again.\" Brian Lowry of CNN said that the film was \"odd on various levels, starting with the wholly misguided attempt to weave a half-baked message into its bloody mayhem\", and wrote: \"If the previous movie conjured a bit of excitement by eradicating everything that had transpired after the original, that sense of novelty has quickly worn off.\"</p><p>Richard Roeper of the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> gave the film a score of 2/4 stars, describing it as a \"thudding disappointment\" and \"an inconsistent, sloppy mess.\" Kevin Maher of <i>The Times</i> gave the film 1/5 stars, describing it as a \"depressingly mechanical gorefest\" that \"has nothing to offer the sentient viewer\". Clarisse Loughrey of <i>The Independent</i> gave the film 2/5 stars, describing it as a \"lurching, directionless corpse of a film\" that \"relies far too much on the knowledge that it has one more instalment \u2026 in which to figure out what the whole blasted trilogy should be about.\" Linda Marric of <i>The Jewish Chronicle</i> also gave the film 2/5 stars, deeming it \"a shambolic, risible mess which is further hampered by a total absence of genuinely scary bits.\" Robbie Collin of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> also gave the film 2/5 stars, writing: \"<i>Halloween Kills</i> certainly feels like more <i>Halloween</i>. But the game board is left exactly as it was found in readiness for round 13; the only thing that advances is the body count.\" However, Aedan Juvet of <i>Bleeding Cool</i> referred to the film as a \"worthwhile middle chapter of a trilogy.\"</p>\n\n<h3>Accolades</h3>\n<h2>Sequel</h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>In July 2019, the film was announced alongside a sequel titled <i>Halloween Ends</i>, which was released on October 14, 2022, in theaters and on paid tiers of Peacock for 60 days. While originally developed to be set on the same night as <i>Halloween</i> (2018) and <i>Halloween Kills</i>, the film takes place four years later in 2022. Green described <i>Ends</i> as a \"coming-of-age story\" and \"a more intimate movie\" where \"some of the characters... have processed the insanity of the circus of the massacre of 2018. And not only that, but they've also processed the world as it's spun so wildly in the last four years.\"</p>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<h2>External links</h2>\n<ul><li><span><span>Official website</span></span></li>\n<li><i>Halloween Kills</i> at IMDb</li>\n<li><i>Halloween Kills</i> at Rotten Tomatoes</li></ul>"
