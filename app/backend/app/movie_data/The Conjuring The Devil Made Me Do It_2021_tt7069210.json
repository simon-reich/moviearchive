    "wikipedia_summary": "The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is a 2021 American supernatural horror film directed by Michael Chaves, with a screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick from a story by Johnson-McGoldrick and James Wan. The film serves as a sequel to The Conjuring (2013) and The Conjuring 2 (2016), and as the seventh installment in The Conjuring Universe. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles as paranormal investigators and authors Ed and Lorraine Warren, with Ruairi O'Connor, Sarah Catherine Hook, and Julian Hilliard also starring. Wan and Peter Safran return to produce the film, which is based on the trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson, a murder trial that took place in 1981 Connecticut, in addition to The Devil in Connecticut, a book about the trial written by Gerald Brittle.\nInitial development for a third Conjuring film began in 2016, though Wan stated that he would not be directing another film in the series due to scheduling conflicts with other projects. Safran confirmed that the next film would not be a haunted house film. By June 2017, it was officially announced that a third installment was in development, with David Leslie Johnson hired to write the screenplay. Michael Chaves was announced as the film's director, after previously directing The Curse of La Llorona (2019). Filming took place in Georgia in summer 2019.\nOriginally slated for a September 2020 release, the film was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It was released by Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema in the United States on June 4, 2021, where it also had a simultaneous month-long release on the HBO Max streaming service. The film grossed $206 million against a budget of $39 million and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Wilson and Farmiga, but criticized the screenplay and noted it to be weaker than the previous installments. A sequel, The Conjuring: Last Rites, is in development.",
    "wikipedia_plot": "In 1981, demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren document the exorcism of 8-year-old David Glatzel, attended by his family, his sister Debbie, her boyfriend Arne Johnson, and Father Gordon in Brookfield, Connecticut. In an attempt to save the little boy, Arne invites the demon to enter his body instead of David's. Ed witnesses the demon enter Arne just as he suffers a heart attack. \nThe following month, Ed wakes up at the hospital and reveals to Lorraine that he witnessed the demon enter Arne. After feeling unwell, Arne murders his landlord by stabbing him 22 times. With the support of the Warrens, his case becomes the first American murder trial where demonic possession is claimed as a defense. The Warrens discover a satanic curse passed on through a witch's totem and meet with Kastner, a former priest who had dealt with the Disciples of the Ram cult. He tells them that an occultist had intentionally left the totem, resulting in the creation of a curse on the Glatzels, causing David's possession.\nThe Warrens travel to Danvers, Massachusetts to investigate the death of Katie Lincoln, who was also stabbed 22 times. Detectives had found a totem at the home of Katie's friend Jessica, who is missing. Lorraine initiates a vision and discovers that Jessica had stabbed Katie while possessed before jumping to her death, which allows detectives to recover Jessica's body. In another vision, she witnesses the occultist attempting to make Arne kill himself but stops her.\nDrew reveals that a book of Stregherian witchcraft states that for the curse to be lifted, the occultist's altar must be destroyed. Ed is affected by the curse when a totem is discovered in flowers delivered to the Warren's house, but is stopped by Drew. Kastner sadly reveals that he'd secretly raised a daughter, Isla, in violation of the requirement of clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church. As he researched the occult, Isla grew fascinated by it and became the occultist. He leads Lorraine into the tunnels underneath the house, where her altar is but Isla kills her father. Ed is briefly bewitched by Isla and attempts to kill Lorraine, but she reminds him of their love. Ed regains his senses and destroys the altar, saving himself, Lorraine and Arne, who had also been about to die. Isla is killed by the demon she'd summoned after failing to complete the curse.\nEd places the cup from the altar in the Warrens' artifact room, along with the Valak painting and the Annabelle doll. Arne is convicted of manslaughter and serves a sentence of five years, marrying Debbie while in prison.",

Hayes also expressed interest in working on a story for another sequel. However, Wan stated that he may be unable to direct the film due to his commitments to other projects. He told Collider, \"Assuming we are lucky enough to have a third chapter, there are other filmmakers that I would love to sort of continue on the <i>Conjuring</i> world, if we are lucky enough\". Wan also noted that, if a third film were to be made, it would ideally take place in the 1980s. Wan later stated that the sequel could include lycanthropy, \"Maybe we can go and do it like a classic <i>American Werewolf in London</i> style. [...] The Warrens set against the backdrop of <i>The Hound of Baskerville</i>\". In May 2017, Safran said it would be unlikely that a third installment would be a \"haunted house\" film.</p><p>In June 2017, it was announced a third installment was in development, with <i>The Conjuring 2</i> co-writer David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick hired to write the screenplay. In August 2017, Wan told <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> that the filmmakers have \"been working hard on <i>The Conjuring 3</i>\u200a\", and that \"we're in the midst of working on the script, and still hashing [it] out. We want to make sure that the script is in a really good place. With how much people have loved the first two [<i>Conjuring</i> films], I don't want to rush in to the third one if possible.\" By September of the following year, producer Peter Safran stated that the script was near completion and that production would begin sometime during 2019. In May 2019, it was revealed that James Wan co-wrote the story with David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick.</p>\n\n<h3>Pre-production</h3>\n<p>In October 2018, it was announced that <i>The Conjuring 3</i> would not be directed by Wan, but instead would be directed by <i>The Curse of La Llorona</i> director Michael Chaves. Wan stated that he was impressed while working with him on <i>The Curse of La Llorona.</i> In December 2018, Wan confirmed the film's plot details. Wan spoke with Bloody Disgusting, saying, \"I think it's the first time in America's history where the defendant used possessions as a reason, as an excuse.\" In October 2019, Joseph Bishara\u2014who composed the scores for <i>The Conjuring</i>, <i>Annabelle</i>, <i>The Conjuring 2</i>, <i>The Curse of La Llorona</i> and <i>Annabelle Comes Home</i>\u2014was confirmed to be returning to score this third <i>Conjuring</i> film.

On August 15, 2019, Farmiga announced that she had finished filming her scenes. Additional photography was initially scheduled for April 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During reshoots, Chaves opted to remove a demonic antagonist, played by Davis Osbourne. The character was supposed to be working with The Occultist, but Chaves believed it \"just wasn't quite connecting\", and instead gave Osbourne a role as an infirmary patient. John Noble's role was also expanded upon during reshoots.</p>\n\n<h2>Release</h2>\n<h3>Theatrical and streaming</h3>\n<p><i>The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It</i> was released in the United Kingdom on May 26, 2021, and in the United States on June 4, 2021, distributed by Warner Bros.
