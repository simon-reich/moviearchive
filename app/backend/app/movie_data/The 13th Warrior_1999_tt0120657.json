While the behavior of the Norsemen initially offends ibn Fadlan, the more cultured outsider grows to respect the tough, if uncouth, warriors. During their travels together, ibn Fadlan and the Vikings get word of an evil presence closing in, and they must fight the frightening and formidable force, which was previously thought to exist only in legend.",

    "wikipedia_summary": "The 13th Warrior is a 1999 American historical fiction action film based on Michael Crichton's 1976 novel Eaters of the Dead, which is a loose adaptation of the tale of Beowulf combined with Ahmad ibn Fadlan's historical account of the Volga Vikings.\nIt stars Antonio Banderas as ibn Fadlan, as well as Diane Venora and Omar Sharif. It was directed by John McTiernan; Crichton directed some uncredited reshoots. The film was produced by McTiernan, Crichton, and Ned Dowd, with Andrew G. Vajna, James Biggam and Ethan Dubrow as executive producers.\nProduction and marketing costs reputedly reached $160 million, but it grossed $61 million at the box office worldwide, becoming the biggest box office bomb of 1999, with losses of up to $129 million.",
    "wikipedia_plot": "Ahmad ibn Fadlan is a court poet of the Abbasid Caliph Al-Muqtadir of Baghdad until his amorous encounter with the wife of an influential noble gets him exiled as an \"ambassador\" to the Volga Bulgars. Traveling with his father's old friend, Melchisidek, his caravan is saved from Tatar raiders by the appearance of Norsemen. He takes refuge at their settlement on the Volga River, and communications are established through Melchisidek, and Herger, one of the Norsemen, happens to speak Latin. From Herger, both learn that the celebration being held by the Norsemen is in fact the precursor to a funeral for their recently-deceased king. Herger also introduces them to one of the king's sons, Buliwyf. Ahmad and Melchisidek witness a fight in which Buliwyf kills his brother in self-defense, which establishes Buliwyf as heir apparent. That is followed by the funeral of the dead king, who is traditionally cremated on a Viking ship, set adrift with a female slave who offers to sacrifice herself and accompany him to Valhalla, the Norse afterlife (or \"heaven\").\nThe next day, the young Prince Wulfgar enters the camp to request Buliwyf's aid; his father, King Hrothgar, has asked for assistance, as his lands in the far north are under attack from an ancient evil so frightening that even the bravest warriors dare not name it. The \"angel of death\", a v\u00f6lva (wisewoman), says that the mission will be successful but only if thirteen warriors face this danger, and the thirteenth must not be a Norseman. Ahmad is automatically and unwillingly recruited.\nAhmad is initially treated indifferently by the Norsemen, but they mock his smaller Arabian horse. However, he earns a measure of respect by quickly learning their language as he starts mentally translating it into English, his demonstration of horsemanship, and his ability to write. Buliwyf, already himself a polyglot, asks Ahmad to teach him the Arabic script, which cements their mutual goodwill. Buliwyf sees Ahmad's analytic ways as an asset to their quest.\nReaching Hrothgar's kingdom, they confirm that their foe is indeed the ancient \"Wendol\", fiends who come with the mist to kill and take human heads. While the group searches through a raided cabin, they find a Venus figurine, which is said to represent the \"Mother of the Wendol\". On the first night, the warriors Hyglak and Ragnar die. After a string of clashes, Buliwyf's band determine that the Wendol are human cannibals, who are clad to appear like bears, live like bears, and think of themselves as bears.\nThe warriors' numbers dwindling, having also lost Skeld, Halga, Roneth, and Rethel, and their positions all but indefensible, they consult another v\u00f6lva of the village. She tells them to track the Wendol to their lair and destroy their leaders, specifically the \"Mother of the Wendol\", and their warlord, who wears \"the horns of power\". Buliwyf and the remaining warriors infiltrate the Wendol caves and kill the Mother but not before Buliwyf is scratched deeply across the shoulder by her toxic fingernail.\nAhmad and the last of the Norse warriors escape the caves but without the injured Helfdane, who opts to stay behind and fight. They return to the village to prepare for a last stand. Buliwyf staggers outside before the battle and inspires the warriors with a Viking prayer for the honored dead who will enter Valhalla. Buliwyf succeeds in killing the Wendol warlord, defeats them, and succumbs to the poison.\nAhmad witnesses Buliwyf's royal funeral before returning to his homeland, grateful to the Norsemen for helping him to \"become a man and a useful servant of God\".",

Crichton took over as director himself because of the poor test audience reception, causing the release date to be pushed back over a year. The film was recut, and a new ending along with a new score was added. Graeme Revell was replaced by Jerry Goldsmith as composer. The title was changed to <i>The 13th Warrior</i>.</p><p>The budget, which was originally around $85 million, reportedly soared to $100 million before principal photography concluded. With all of the re-shoots and promotional expenses, the total cost of the film was rumored to be as high as $160 million, which, given its lackluster box office take (earning US$61.7 million worldwide), made for a loss of $70\u2013130 million.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception</h2>\n<p>The film debuted at No. 2 on its opening weekend behind <i>The Sixth Sense</i>.</p><p><i>The 13th Warrior</i> holds a 33% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 88 reviews. The consensus is: \"Atmospheric, great sets and costumes, but thin plot.\"</p><p>Roger Ebert gave the film one and a half stars out of four, remarking that it \"lumber[s] from one expensive set-piece to the next without taking the time to tell a story that might make us care.\" Conversely, James Berardinelli gave <i>The 13th Warrior</i> three stars out of four, calling it \"a solid offering\" that \"delivers an exhilarating 100 minutes\".Lisa Schwarzbaum of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> rated it A\u2212 and called it \"the most unexpectedly audacious, exhilarating, and wildly creative adventure thriller I have seen in ages\".</p><p>The outcome of the film's production disappointed Omar Sharif so much that he temporarily retired from film acting, not taking a role in another major film until 2003's <i>Monsieur Ibrahim</i>:\n</p>\n<dl><dd>\"After my small role in <i>The 13th Warrior</i>, I said to myself, 'Let us stop this nonsense, these meal tickets that we do because it pays well.' I thought, 'Unless I find a stupendous film that I love and that makes me want to leave home to do, I will stop.' Bad pictures are very humiliating, I was really sick. It is terrifying to have to do the dialogue from bad scripts, to face a director who does not know what he is doing, in a film so bad that it is not even worth exploring.\"</dd></dl>\n\n<h2>Soundtrack</h2>\n<p>The original soundtrack was composed by Graeme Revell and featured the Dead Can Dance singer Lisa Gerrard. The score was rejected by Michael Crichton and was replaced by one composed by Crichton's usual collaborator, Jerry Goldsmith.</p>\n\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul><li>List of historical drama films</li>\n<li>List of box office bombs</li></ul>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<h2>External links</h2>\n\n<ul><li><i>The 13th Warrior</i> at IMDb </li>\n<li><i>The 13th Warrior</i> at AllMovie</li>\n<li><i>The 13th Warrior</i> at Box Office Mojo</li>\n<li><i>The 13th Warrior</i> at Rotten Tomatoes</li>\n<li>Interview</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1406\nCached time: 20240322192901\nCache expiry: 3600\nReduced expiry: true\nComplications: [vary\u2010revision\u2010sha1, show\u2010toc, is\u2010preview]\nCPU time usage: 0.566 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.720 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 3016/1000000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 94888/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 8154/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 23/100\nExpensive parser function count: 3/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 1/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 72926/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.327/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 7622030/52428800 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%  609.367      1 -total\n 25.18%  153.461      1 Template:Reflist\n 18.40%  112.127     11 Template:Cite_web\n 16.34%   99.570      3 Template:Navbox\n 14.41%   87.790      1 Template:John_McTiernan\n 14.13%   86.111      1 Template:Infobox_film\n 13.68%   83.334      1 Template:IMDb_title\n 11.56%   70.447      1 Template:Infobox\n 10.33%   62.922      1 Template:Short_description\n  6.52%   39.711      1 Template:Authority_control\n-->"
