Working mostly with unknown actors, Diop focused in the film on issues such as the refugee crisis, remorse, loss, grief, class struggle, and taking responsibility (or not) for one's actions.

The website's critics consensus reads, \"An unpredictable supernatural drama rooted in real-world social commentary, <i>Atlantique</i> suggests a thrillingly bright future for debuting filmmaker Mati Diop.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 85 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".</p><p>Hannah Giorgis of <i>The Atlantic</i> commented, \"In <i>Atlantics</i>, the Cannes Grand Prix\u2013winning film by the French-Senegalese director Mati Diop, the water is both a threat and a source of comfort. With soft camerawork and pointed dialogue, Diop casts a shadow over the sea and all its possibilities... The result is a transportive love story with an undercurrent of social critique that manages to be at once haunting and hopeful.\" K. Austin Collins writing for <i>Vanity Fair</i> stated, \"<i>Atlantics</i> stuns and surprises because it tries to pull off something slippery and hard to define, a ghost story (or is it a zombie story?) that\u2019s rooted in the material reality of Dakar and its lower classes, that\u2019s openly political, accordingly, but which also seems flickering and unreal, alive to whatever these mysteries have in store.\" Bilal Qureshi of NPR said, \"<i>Atlantics</i> is a ghost story about migration. It dramatizes the stories of the young men who leave countries like Senegal in hopes of reaching Europe, and how their absence \u2014 and their loss \u2014 haunts the women they leave behind.\" Jay Weissberg writing for <i>Variety</i> stated, \"The capricious ocean is a recurrent, mesmerizing image in Mati Diop\u2019s feature debut <i>Atlantics</i>, but given its perfidious connotations for the people of Senegal, who\u2019ve lost so many souls to its depths, the director ensures the rolling waves remain hypnotic rather than beautiful. It\u2019s the right decision for this romantic and melancholy film, more apt than some of the flawed narrative choices that frustrate though don\u2019t compromise the atmosphere of loss and female solidarity in the story of a young woman whose love has died at sea.\"</p><p>Justin Chang in his review for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> noted, \"Drawing on a potent vein of local mythology, Diop weaves these paranormal elements into her canvas with thrift, ingenuity and bracing matter-of-factness. In her hands, a vengeful ghost seems no more absurd or irrational than, say, the futuristic high-rise tower that\u2019s being erected on the coast.\" Kelsey Adams of <i>Now</i> gave the film four stars out of five and wrote, \"Although it\u2019s a migrant story, it focuses on those left behind. As the distressed women grapple with the departure of their men, things turn increasingly uncanny. Unexplained arson and illnesses shift <i>Atlantics</i> into supernatural territory, and Diop incorporates elements of Muslim mysticism and French folklore without being gimmicky. The deft blend of fantasy and drama uses supernatural elements to home in on the abundant, unjust realities the characters face.\" David Fear of <i>Rolling Stone</i> gave the film four and half stars out of five, commenting \"even when things start to dip into supernatural territory, Atlantics remains oddly grounded, still dedicated to tackling a topical subject without being dogmatic. You feel as if you\u2019re watching something that\u2019s region-specific, yet it never makes its characters feel like \u201cothers.\u201d Nor do you ever sense that the act of giving these often agency-less females a voice is something based in charity, because Diop makes the endeavor feel like a necessity.\" Namwali Serpell of <i>The Nation</i> stated, \"In its origins in Arabian thought, a djinn can be good or bad. In its origins in the black diaspora, a zombie is a slave forced to do the bidding of others. Diop mixes the two phenomena to the same counterintuitive end: The dispossessed\u2014male and female, management and labor\u2014rise up not as the enemy but as the communal hero.\"</p><p>In her review for <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>, Leslie Felperin noted, \"Exquisitely shot by Claire Mathon and lushly scored by Fatima Al Qadiri, the film pulls together some exceedingly strong components [...] A lot of ideas about class, post-imperialism and spiritual values peek up out of the surface of the text, but they\u2019re not developed with much rigor compared to what Diop conjured with more intensity and less time in <i>A Thousand Suns.</i>\" Richard Brody of <i>The New Yorker</i> noted, \"Diop films the characters and the city with a tactile intimacy and a teeming energy that are heightened by the soundtrack\u2019s polyphony of voices and music; she dramatizes the personal experience of public matters\u2014religious tradition, women\u2019s autonomy, migration, corruption\u2014with documentary-based fervor, rhapsodic yearning, and bold affirmation.\" Monica Castillo of <i>RogerEbert.com</i> gave the film four stars out of four, commenting, \"On the surface, this is a familiar story of lovers kept apart by circumstances beyond their control, but <i>Atlantics</i> quickly reveals itself to be so much deeper that. Diop, who co-wrote the screenplay with Olivier Demangel, blends the story with the desperation that forces them to leave home and loved ones, echoes of the refugee crisis, a look at the exploitation of the poor by the wealthy and the fetishization of virginity, purity, and marriage. The mystery of <i>Atlantics</i> unravels slowly, its gentle twists keep surprises hidden in plain sight.\"</p><p><i>The Guardian'</i>s Peter Bradshaw gave the film four stars out of five and wrote, \"<i>Atlantique</i> is about the return of the repressed, or the suppressed: the men who were denied their rightful pay on the building site then faced the real possibility of a watery grave. Their spirit rises up, and this becomes a ghost story or a revenge story. <i>Atlantique</i> may not be perfect, but I admired the way that Diop did not simply submit to the realist mode expected from this kind of material, and yet neither did she go into a clich\u00e9d magic-realist mode, nor make the romantic story the film\u2019s obvious centre. Her film has a seductive mystery.\" IndieWire's Eric Kohn gave the movie B+ grade and noted, \"As it ventures further along its spellbinding path, <i>Atlantics</i> remains a deeply romantic work that magnetized the fears of people trapped by their surroundings and striving for the companionship that can rescue them from despair. It doesn\u2019t quite let them get there, but Diop doesn\u2019t strike a hopeless tone the whole way through. Ultimately, <i>Atlantics</i> shows how that even these bleak circumstances can have empowering ramifications for the women trapped by the shore, and why it\u2019s a portal to a better life even if they stay put.\"</p>\n\n<h3>Accolades</h3>\n<p>At Cannes, the film won the Grand Prix.
