    "wikipedia_plot": "A nurse named Katie fails to save the life of a patient in her care, despite attempting CPR.\nSome time later, Katie, now referring to herself as Maud, has become a devout Roman Catholic and is working as a private palliative care nurse in an English seaside town. She is assigned to care for Amanda, a hedonistic former dancer and choreographer from the United States who is terminally ill with stage four lymphoma. Amanda is embittered by her fate and confesses to Maud that she fears the oblivion of death. Maud comes to believe that God has tasked her with saving the atheist Amanda's soul. Maud reveals to Amanda that she sometimes feels God's presence, and she and Amanda appear to be overcome with ecstasy as they pray together.\nMaud becomes suspicious of Amanda's lesbian companion Carol, who visits regularly and with whom Amanda has sex. She implores Carol to stop visiting because she believes Amanda's soul is in jeopardy due to distractions of the flesh. Carol is incensed by this, accusing Maud of homophobia, but Maud rebukes this stating that she would not care whether Carol were a man or a woman. Carol attends Amanda's birthday party anyway, and in front of Maud, Amanda informs the partygoers that Maud tried to drive Carol away. The party guests laugh at Maud, calling her \"Saint Maude\", and wrap a cover on her head. Amanda mocks Maud for trying to save her soul and suggests that she is a homophobic prude, jealous of her relationship with Carol. Maud strikes Amanda and is dismissed from her job.\nBelieving that God has rejected her, Maud visits a pub to find companionship but is rejected by most of the people she meets. She goes home with a man and during sex suffers flashbacks of the death of her patient and her attempts at CPR, which causes her to stop. The man feigns sympathy but continues to have sex with Maud, who appears to dissociate in response. As she is leaving, he taunts her by revealing that he remembers her hooking up with a friend of his during her hedonic past.\nWhile out walking, she encounters Amanda's new nurse and storms off when she realizes that her replacement enjoys a good relationship with Amanda. In her decrepit apartment, Maud begs for a sign from God who appears to tell her to be ready for an act that will demonstrate her faith. Repentant of her actions, Maud assembles a spugna for her right foot to practice the mortification of the flesh.\nThat night, Maud, dressed in a makeshift robe and wearing rosary beads, enters Amanda's house after the care nurse leaves. She finds Amanda in bed, weakened. Amanda asks forgiveness for mocking her faith, and Maud joyously reminds her of the time they experienced God's presence. Amanda reveals that she feigned the experience and that she believes God is not real. Maud recoils in horror as a now-demonic Amanda hurls her across the room and mocks her for needing to prove her faith. In a delirious frenzy, Maud stabs Amanda to death with a pair of scissors.\nIn the morning, Maud wanders onto a beach and douses herself with acetone before horrified onlookers. She utters her last words in Welsh\u2014\"Glory to God\"\u2014as she self-immolates. In her last moments, angel wings appear upon her and the onlookers kneel in awe as Maud looks up to the sky glowing with grace. The scene then smash-cuts for a split second to the horrific reality of Maud being burned alive and screaming in agony.",

If she was raised in the church, we have no hint of it. If she's acting out of a zealous, recent conversion, those details are left vague. I think this disinterest in the nature of Maud's faith is a fault of the film, which could be accused of exploiting both religion and mental illness for ghastly thrills.\nFilm critic Mark Kermode listed it as his favourite film of 2020, calling it an \"electrifying debut\".",

Maud is a deeply lonely character, whose need for redemption and a desire to belong, all contribute to form a dangerous cocktail with devastating consequences.\"</p><p>Film reviewer Josh Larsen of <i>Think Christian</i> criticized the film:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>It's interesting to me that aside from some of her basic devotional habits, we learn little about Maud's faith. If she was raised in the church, we have no hint of it. If she's acting out of a zealous, recent conversion, those details are left vague. I think this disinterest in the nature of Maud's faith is a fault of the film, which could be accused of exploiting both religion and mental illness for ghastly thrills.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Film critic Mark Kermode listed it as his favourite film of 2020, calling it an \"electrifying debut\".</p>\n\n<h3>Accolades</h3>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<h2>External links</h2>\n<ul><li><i>Saint Maud</i> at IMDb</li>\n<li><i>Saint Maud</i> at the British Film Institute</li></ul>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nParsed by mw1386\nCached time: 20231202234511\nCache expiry: 3600\nReduced expiry: true\nComplications: [vary\u2010revision\u2010sha1, show\u2010toc]\nCPU time usage: 0.543 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.686 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 3645/1000000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 94945/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 8984/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 24/100\nExpensive parser function count: 3/500\nUnstrip recursion depth: 1/20\nUnstrip post\u2010expand size: 93870/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.327/10.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 9004705/52428800 bytes\nNumber of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%  619.375      1 -total\n 27.33%  169.287      1 Template:Reflist\n 27.22%  168.575     22 Template:Cite_web\n 19.68%  121.913      1 Template:Rotten_Tomatoes_prose\n 14.49%   89.763      1 Template:Infobox_film\n 12.43%   76.969      1 Template:Infobox\n 10.90%   67.507      1 Template:London_Film_Critics_Circle_Award_for_British_Film_of_the_Year\n 10.61%   65.737      1 Template:Navbox\n  8.25%   51.106      1 Template:Short_description\n  7.23%   44.800      8 Template:Wikidata\n-->"
