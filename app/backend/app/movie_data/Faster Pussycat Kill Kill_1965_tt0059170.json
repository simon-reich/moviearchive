After breaking Tommy's neck in a fight, Varla kidnaps and drugs Linda.\nIn a small desert town, they stop at a gas station where they see a wheelchair-using old man and his muscular, dim-witted son. The gas station attendant tells the women that the old man was disabled in a railway accident, \"going nuts\" as a result, and that he received a large settlement of money that is hidden somewhere around his decrepit house in the desert. Intrigued, Varla hatches a scheme to rob the old man, and the three women follow him back to the ranch, with their captive in tow.\nAt the ranch, they encounter the old man, his younger son (who they learn is known as \"The Vegetable\" due to his feeblemindedness) and his elder son, Kirk. The group all have lunch together, and Billie taunts Rosie when Varla leaves with Kirk, hoping to seduce him into revealing the location of the money. Linda subsequently escapes the drunken Billie and runs away into the desert. The old man and the younger son pursue in their truck.

Billie refuses, but as she walks away, Varla throws a knife into her back just as the old man and his younger son arrive.

Kill! Kill!</i> was a follow-up to an earlier Meyer film. \"'We had just done a film called <i>Motorpsycho</i>, which was about three bad boys, and it had gone through the roof. So I said, 'Well, let's do one with three bad girls'.\"</p><p>The screenplay is credited to Jack Moran from an original story by Russ Meyer. The first draft was titled <i>The Leather Girls</i> and was written over a brief four-day period by Moran, who also collaborated with Meyer on <i>Common Law Cabin</i> and <i>Good Morning and... Goodbye!</i> The screenplay went through a second working title\u2014<i>The Mankillers</i>\u2014and had already begun production when the sound editor, Richard S. Brummer, came up with the now-immortal final title. Although neither Moran nor Meyer overtly cited any prior works as inspiration, the plot has been called a \"loose remake of <i>The Desperate Hours</i>, or possibly <i>The Virgin Spring</i>\" by one prominent film critic and a \"pop-art setting of Aeschylus's <i>Eumenides</i>\" by one classical scholar.</p>\n\n<h3>Casting</h3>\n<p>Haji had worked with Meyer on <i>Motorpsycho</i>. She recommended Tura Satana to him.</p><p>Lori Williams later said, \"Russ didn't want to hire me because he didn't think I had a big enough bust! I said I could use pushups in my bra, which I did.  He didn't know whether it would work, but then in rehearsals he finally said okay. I kind of did my part like a cartoon, like the rest of the film, bigger than life.\"</p>\n\n<h3>Filming</h3>\n<p><i>Faster, Pussycat!</i> had a modest budget of about $45,000 and was shot in black and white in order to save money.</p><p>The film began shooting at the Pussycat Club, a strip club in Van Nuys, before moving on to the California desert later that night. The film's early racing scene was shot on the dry salt flats of Cuddeback Lake, the gas station scene was filmed in the town of Randsburg, and the scenes at the Old Man's house at Ollie Peche's Musical Wells Ranch outside the town of Mojave. During principal photography, the cast and crew stayed at the Adobe Motel in Johannesburg.</p><p>Meyer, who got his start making films while serving in the US Army's 166th Signal Photographic Company during World War II, had a reputation for running strictly regimented film shoots with a small crew composed largely of former Army buddies. Actor Charles Napier, who appeared in five of Meyer's films, said that \"Working with Russ Meyer was like being in the first wave landing in Normandy during World War II.\" Meyer considered the <i>Faster, Pussycat!</i> shoot no different, saying \"It was the usual thing with me. It's like being in the military. Everybody has to get up and do their jobs to get things together, and that's it.\" Meyer's directorial style and the rules he imposed upon cast and crew caused clashes with his equally strong-willed star, Tura Satana.</p><p>There was also friction between Susan Bernard and her director and co-stars, much of which they attributed to the presence of her mother on the set (necessitated by Bernard's being a sixteen-year-old minor at the time). Bernard has said in interviews that she was truly scared of Satana, and some have thought that this contributed to her performance as a frightened kidnapping victim.</p><p>\nAccording to Satana,</p><blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>Everybody [on set] did everything from moving props to marking scenery and marking spots where we had to be in the next take.  I had to stage the fight scenes because nobody else knew how to do them, and so literally when I did the fight scenes, I really had to pick up each and every one of those guys and carry them through in order for them to look realistic. Basically I had to lay one guy on the floor because he was afraid he was going to get hurt.  A lot of it actually had to be done in reverse, so try to imagine doing a fight scene that way.</p></blockquote>\n\n<h3>Music</h3>\n<p>The film's title song, \"Faster Pussycat!\", was performed by California band, the Bostweeds. The lyrics were written by Rick Jarrard and the music was written and sung by Lynn Ready, who formed the Bostweeds and sang leads. The track was never released commercially, but it did appear in February 1966 as a promotional-only 45 rpm single without a B-side.</p>\n\n<h2>Reception and influence</h2>\n<h3>Box office</h3>\n<p><i>Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!</i> premiered in Los Angeles on August 6, 1965. Atypically for a Meyer film, it was a box office failure upon its initial release.</p><p>\"When it first came out, it was not successful\", said Meyer. \"At the time, people didn't understand that women could have a relationship with other women.\"</p>\n\n<h3>Critical response</h3>\n<p>It was generally dismissed as an exploitative \"skin flick\" by the few critics who took any note of it at all. John L. Wasserman of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, for example, reviewed a double bill of <i>Faster, Pussycat!</i> and <i>Mudhoney</i> in April 1966, saying that \"<i>Pussycat</i> has the worst script ever written, and <i>Mudhoney</i> is the worst movie ever made.\"</p>\n\n<h3>Cult status</h3>\n<p>In the years since, the film has been regarded more favorably, gaining in both commercial and critical stature. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 74% based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"<i>Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!</i> is undoubtedly shlock, but director Russ Meyer's infectious affection for camp gives this anarchic joyride exhilarating flair.\" In his review of the film's 1995 re-release, Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars. Noted feminist film critic B. Ruby Rich said that when she first saw <i>Faster, Pussycat!</i> in the 1970s she \"was absolutely outraged that [she had] been forced to watch this misogynist film that objectified women and that was really just short of soft-core porn.\" Upon viewing it again in the early 1990s, however, she \"just loved it\" and wrote a piece in <i>The Village Voice</i> reappraising the film and discussing her change in opinion.</p><p><i>Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!</i> is currently number 674 on the tenth edition of the often-referenced \"1,000 Greatest Films\" list and 377th on the <i>Sight &amp; Sound</i> \"Greatest Films Poll\". It is frequently mentioned on lists of the best B movies and cult films of all time.</p><p>The film has also been influential on other filmmakers. Writer-director John Waters stated in his book <i>Shock Value</i> that \"<i>Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!</i> is, beyond a doubt, the best movie ever made. It is possibly better than any film that will be made in the future.\" He later said on its re-release that \"it ages like fine wine.\" Music video director Keir McFarlane acknowledged that a scene in the video for the Janet Jackson song \"You Want This\" was a direct homage to <i>Faster, Pussycat!</i>, showing the Porsche-driving singer and her female companions driving circles around two men in the desert.  The music video for Say You'll Be There by Spice Girls was also inspired by this film. Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino referenced the film and thanked Meyer in the credits of his film <i>Death Proof</i>, and it was reported in <i>Variety</i> in 2008 that Tarantino was interested in remaking <i>Faster, Pussycat!</i></p>\n\n<h2>Television adaptation</h2>\n<p>In May 2021, it was reported that a television series adaptation of the film is in development from bigbaldhead Productions, the production company run by Norman Reedus, and AMC Studios.</p>\n\n<h2>In popular culture</h2>\n<ul><li>American glam metal band Faster Pussycat took their name from the film.</li>\n<li>American punk rock band Frightwig named their second album \"Faster, Frightwig, Kill! Kill!</li>\n<li>Audio samples from the film are featured in four songs by metal band White Zombie on their third album, <i>La Sexorcisto: Devil Music, Vol. 1</i>. The dialogue \"You're all shook up, aren't you, baby?\" and \"I never try anything, I just do it. Wanna try me?\" are used in the song \"Thunder Kiss '65\". \"You're all shook up, aren't you, baby?\" is also used in the song \"Cosmic Monsters, Inc.\" and the line \"Now let's move, but let's take the back door\" in the song \"Welcome to Planet Motherfucker/Psychoholic Slag\". Another line, \"I work on this baby the same way, trying to get maximum performance\", is used in \"Black Sunshine\".</li>\n<li>The title of Daniel Clowes's graphic novel <i>Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron</i> is taken from a line in the film describing Varla.</li>\n<li>The film's title song, \"Faster Pussycat!\", has been covered several times, most notably by American punk band the Cramps on their 1983 live mini-album <i>Smell of Female</i>.</li>\n<li>The music video for the Janet Jackson song \"You Want This\" from her self-titled 1993 album <i>Janet</i> pays homage to the film and centers around Jackson as a female gang leader, with the singer and her friends encountering two men in a desert setting.</li>\n<li>The music video for the Spice Girls song \"Say You'll Be There\" was inspired by the <i>Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!</i> film (and <i>Pulp Fiction</i>). The music video features the group members as female techno-warriors who use martial arts and ninja-influenced weapons to capture a hapless male, much like the film.</li>\n<li>In Quentin Tarantino's 2007 film <i>Death Proof</i>, the character Shanna is wearing a T-shirt featuring Tura Satana's character Varla with the words \"BADASS CINEMA\" underneath it. Meyer is also one of the directors Tarantino thanks in the end credits.</li>\n<li>Reference is made to a poster of the film in Amy Vincent's 2008 teen novel (under the pen name Claudia Grey) <i>Evernight</i> (at page 134) on the dorm room door of one of the supporting characters.</li>\n<li>The three main antagonist characters in John Lee's 2016 movie <i>Pee-wee's Big Holiday</i> were inspired by the film.</li>\n<li>The film's over-the-top title has become iconic and is frequently referenced or played upon in other popular culture:\n<ul><li>The 2008 song \"Funplex\" by the B-52's features the lyrics \"Faster pussycat, thrill thrill\", an allusion to the film's title.</li>\n<li>In the <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> episode \"Passion\", Xander Harris encourages Buffy and the others to go after the vampire Angelus, saying \"If Giles wants to go after the, uh, fiend that murdered his girlfriend, I say, 'Faster, pussycat, kill, kill'.\"</li>\n<li>An <i>Itchy &amp; Scratchy</i> short entitled \"Foster Pussycat!
