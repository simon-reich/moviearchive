    "plot": "Change and a city in China. In Chengdu, factory 420 is being pulled down to make way for multi-story buildings with luxury flats. Scenes of factory operations, of the workforce, and of buildings stripped bare and then razed, are inter-cut with workers who were born in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s telling their stories - about the factory, which manufactured military aircraft, and about their work and their lives. A middle-aged man visits his mentor, now elderly; a woman talks of being a 19-year-old beauty there and ending up alone. The film concludes with two young people talking, each the child of workers, each relaying a story of one visit to a factory. Times change.",

The film follows three generations of characters in Chengdu (in the 1950s, the 1970s and the present) as a state-owned factory gives way to a modern apartment complex. The film was also known as The Story of 24 City during production.\r\nThe apartment complex featured in the film is an actual development (also called \"24 City\") built on the former site of an airplane engine manufacturing facility. Jia will also produce a documentary about the location.\r\nThe film's narrative style is described by critics as a blend of fictive and documentary story-telling, and it consists of authentic interviews and fictive scenes delivered by actors (but presented in a documentary format).\r\n24 City made its debut shown in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. Film Comment, the official journal of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, listed the film at the end of 2008 as the second-best unreleased (without U.S. theatrical release) film of the year.\r\nThe Hollywood Reporter called the film a \"moving elegy to modern-day China\" and said of the film's documentary strain that it \"prevails to simple, yet emotionally reverberating effect\".\r\nTime also reviewed the film favorably: \"the film interweaves the political overview \u2014 of a city institution being torn down to be replaced by commercial and residential buildings \u2014 with personal anecdotes that are poignant and charming.\"\r\nScreen International states \"the latest chapter in Jia Zhangke's chronicles of modern Chinese history is certain to reinforce the director's status as an international arthouse icon.\"\r\nThe New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis gave the film a rave and stated \"...the often amazing and intricately structured '24 City,' the latest from the Chinese director Jia Zhang-ke...shot in digital so sharp it looks hyper-real and projected digitally, the movie takes as its point of departure the closing of a state-owned munitions factory in southwest China... Mr. Jia is one of the most original filmmakers working today, creating movies about a country that seems like a sequel.\"\r\nAnthony Kaufman of IndieWIRE praised the film and states \"Jia's masterful aesthetic remains consistent, mixing documentary and fiction with intriguing results.\"\r\nJ. Hoberman of the Village Voice described the film as \"so meaningfully framed that it could have been shot by Andy Warhol or Chantal Akerman\", and called the film as one of the stand-outs of this year's films in competition at the Cannes Film Festival.\r\nCurrently, the film holds a 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 43 reviews, with an average score of 7.4/10. The consensus reads, \"One of China's most talented directors blurs the lines between non-fiction, drama, and musical theater in this vivid portrait of a country in cultural flux.\" On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 75 out of 100, based on 11 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".",
