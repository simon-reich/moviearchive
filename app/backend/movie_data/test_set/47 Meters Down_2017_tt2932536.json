The two films have grossed over $100 million worldwide.\r\nPlot\r\nSisters Lisa (Mandy Moore) and Kate (Claire Holt) are on vacation in Mexico after Lisa's boyfriend recently broke up with her. They decide to go watch sharks from a diving cage with two local men. At the docks, Lisa is wary of the boat and its owner, Captain Taylor (Matthew Modine). Kate is a certified diver, but Lisa is new to diving. They lie to Taylor and tell him that Lisa is experienced. Unbeknownst to everyone, the cable supporting the cage is fraying.\r\nWhen Taylor sends Lisa and Kate down, they are surrounded by great white sharks; however, the cable breaks, and the cage sinks to the bottom which is 47 meters below the surface and out of communication range with the boat. Kate swims up seven meters to resume communication with Taylor, who tells her that Javier (Chris J. Johnson) will be coming down with a spare winch cable to attach to the cage. He advises them to stay in the cage because the sharks are close by, both women are running out of air but soon see a flashlight in the distance. With Kate low on air from the previous swim, Lisa swims out to get Javier's attention. A shark tries to attack her but she avoids it.\r\nLisa becomes disoriented about her position; Javier attempts to usher her back towards safety, but he is killed by a great white shark, Lisa takes his spear gun and the winch cable and swims back to the cage. The spare cable is attached but it also snaps and the cage sinks back down, landing on Lisa's leg and pinning her. Kate tells Taylor they are low on air and Lisa is trapped, he sends air tanks down and tells them the coast guard is an hour out, he also warns that the second tank may cause nitrogen narcosis, which can lead to hallucinations. Kate finds three flares to signal the coast guard. As she returns to the cage, she is attacked and (presumably) devoured by a great white shark. Lisa uses the spear from the spear gun to pull a tank toward her and dons it, getting more air.\r\nKate is injured and her blood is attracting more sharks. Lisa uses her BCD to lift up the cage, freeing her leg; due to the nature of Kate's wounds, the sisters decide to swim to the surface, using one of the flares to scare off the sharks, at the 20-meter mark, Taylor reminds them they must wait five minutes to decompress and avoid the bends. Kate accidentally drops the second flare and lights the third, discovering that they are surrounded by sharks.\r\nTaylor yells for them to drop their gear and make a break for the surface, and they swim as fast as they can, one of the sharks bites Lisa's leg but she escapes, both women make it to the boat but Lisa is attacked again, she sticks her fingers in the shark's eye and it releases her. The men pull the sisters onto the boat, saving them.\r\nThen it is revealed that Lisa has been hallucinating all this time due to nitrogen narcosis and that she is still at the bottom of the ocean with her leg pinned under the cage. Coast guard divers arrive to rescue her and carry her to the surface whereas her sister has already been killed by the great white shark.\r\nCast\r\nMandy Moore as Lisa, Kate's older sister.\r\nClaire Holt as Kate, Lisa's younger sister.\r\nChris J.

Additional photography took place in January 2016.\r\nRelease\r\nOriginal distributor Dimension Films had initially set a North American DVD and VOD release date for 2 August 2016. However, on 25 July 2016, Variety reported that Dimension had sold the rights to Entertainment Studios. Entertainment Studios cancelled the 2 August home release and instead committed to a theatrical release in the United States in summer 2017. The working title for the film was 47 Meters Down, which Dimension had changed to In the Deep for their home release, but upon acquiring the film Entertainment Studios reverted to the original title. Dimension had already sent out screeners and shipped DVDs to retailers before the deal took place. The DVDs, under the title In the Deep, were recalled. However, several retailers broke the street date, and a handful of physical copies were sold and have since turned up on eBay as collectors' items.\r\nThe film was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on 26 July 2017 & United States on 16 June 2017, and spent about $30 million on prints and advertising.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\n47 Meters Down grossed $44.3 million in the United States and Canada and $17.4 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $61.7 million, against a production budget of $5.5 million.\r\nIn North America, 47 Meters Down was released alongside All Eyez on Me, Rough Night and Cars 3, and was initially projected to gross around $5 million from 2,300 theatres in its opening weekend. It made $4.5 million on its first day (including $735,000 from Thursday night previews), increasing weekend estimates to $11 million. It went on to debut to $11.5 million, finishing 5th at the box office. In its second weekend, the film dropped 34%, grossing $7.4 million and finishing 4th at the box office. It was the second highest-grossing indie film of 2017.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 54% based on 155 reviews, with an average rating of 5.28/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"47 Meters Down doesn't take its terrifying premise quite as far as it should, but its toothy antagonists still offer a few thrills for less demanding genre enthusiasts.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighed average score of 52 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 55% overall positive score.\r\nJoe Leydon of Variety wrote: \"Director Johannes Roberts' mostly underwater thriller is a compact and sturdily crafted B-movie that generates enough scares and suspense to qualify as \u2014 well, maybe not a pleasant surprise, but a reasonably entertaining one.\"\r\nAccolades\r\nSequel\r\nOn 8 September 2017, it was announced that production studio, The Fyzz Facility, is working on a sequel titled 48 Meters Down, in which Roberts, Riera, and Harris & Lane will return as director/writer, co-writer, and producers, respectively. The sequel will take place in Mexico and center around a group of young women who decide to explore some hidden underwater ruins located off-the-beaten trail. Production will be overseen by Altitude Film Sales, with potential buyers currently being sought in Toronto. Entertainment Studios once again handled the distribution for the film. The film was released in theatres on 16 August 2019. In August 2018, the film's first trailer was released with a new official title 47 Meters Down: The Next Chapter. By December of the same year, the official title of the film will be 47 Meters Down: Uncaged. None of the cast from the previous film returns in the sequel. The new cast members are John Corbett, Nia Long, Sophie Nelisse, Corinne Foxx, Sistine Stallone, Brianne Tju, Davi Santos, Khylin Rhambo and Brec Bassinger.",

However, several retailers broke the street date, and a handful of physical copies were sold and have since turned up on eBay as collectors' items.</p><p>The film was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on 26 July 2017 & United States on 16 June 2017, and spent about $30 million on prints and advertising.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Box office</h4><p>47 Meters Down grossed $44.3 million in the United States and Canada and $17.4 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $61.7 million, against a production budget of $5.5 million.</p><p>In North America, 47 Meters Down was released alongside All Eyez on Me, Rough Night and Cars 3, and was initially projected to gross around $5 million from 2,300 theatres in its opening weekend. It made $4.5 million on its first day (including $735,000 from Thursday night previews), increasing weekend estimates to $11 million. It went on to debut to $11.5 million, finishing 5th at the box office. In its second weekend, the film dropped 34%, grossing $7.4 million and finishing 4th at the box office. It was the second highest-grossing indie film of 2017.</p><h4>Critical response</h4><p>On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 54% based on 155 reviews, with an average rating of 5.28/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"47 Meters Down doesn't take its terrifying premise quite as far as it should, but its toothy antagonists still offer a few thrills for less demanding genre enthusiasts.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighed average score of 52 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 55% overall positive score.</p><p>Joe Leydon of Variety wrote: \"Director Johannes Roberts' mostly underwater thriller is a compact and sturdily crafted B-movie that generates enough scares and suspense to qualify as \u2014 well, maybe not a pleasant surprise, but a reasonably entertaining one.\"</p><h4>Accolades</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"><th scope=\"col\">Award</th><th scope=\"col\">Date of ceremony</th><th scope=\"col\">Category</th><th scope=\"col\">Recipient(s)</th><th scope=\"col\">Result</th><th scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"><abbr title=\"Reference\">Ref.</abbr></th></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\"><span>Saturn Awards</span></th><td><span>June 2018</span></td><td><span>Best Horror Film</span></td><td><i>47 Meters Down</i></td><td style=\"background: #FDD; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\" class=\"no table-no2\">Nominated</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><h3>Sequel</h3><p>On 8 September 2017, it was announced that production studio, The Fyzz Facility, is working on a sequel titled 48 Meters Down, in which Roberts, Riera, and Harris & Lane will return as director/writer, co-writer, and producers, respectively. The sequel will take place in Mexico and center around a group of young women who decide to explore some hidden underwater ruins located off-the-beaten trail. Production will be overseen by Altitude Film Sales, with potential buyers currently being sought in Toronto. Entertainment Studios once again handled the distribution for the film.
