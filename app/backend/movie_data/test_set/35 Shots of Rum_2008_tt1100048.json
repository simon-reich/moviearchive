The film had its world premiere out of competition at the 65th Venice International Film Festival on 2 September 2008. It was released in France on 18 February 2009, and in Germany on 5 March 2009.\r\nPlot\r\nLionel (Alex Descas), a widower who drives RER trains in metropolitan Paris, has raised his daughter Josephine (Mati Diop) alone for many years. They have always shared a special bond and live a secure and contented life somewhat isolated from others, in an apartment building in a suburb of Paris. Josephine, an anthropology student, is now grown and become a young woman, but she remains deeply devoted to her father.\r\nThey have developed a loose family with some of the other residents of the building: Gabrielle (Nicole Dogue), a cab driver, who once had a love affair with Lionel; and No\u00e9 (Gr\u00e9goire Colin), a moody young man who lives with his cat and has feelings for Josephine. No\u00e9 leads a disorganized life and goes abroad often. Gabrielle appears to have feelings for Lionel and motherly feelings towards Josephine. However, both father and daughter are ambivalent toward more than a casual friendship with anyone outside their special relationship.\r\nWhile attending the retirement party for a colleague and friend, Lionel declines to try the customary feat of downing 35 shots of rum. His colleague appears to be lost without his job, and Lionel realizes that time is moving on. He (Lionel) must find meaning and security in things other than his present life, lest he end up the same way. During an outing with Gabrielle and No\u00e9, their car breaks down and the four friends take refuge in a closed bar. No\u00e9 shows his feelings for Josephine, and Lionel realizes that she must eventually leave him. He knows that she needs to live her own life independent of him. It is subtly suggested that Josephine decides to marry No\u00e9 in a scene of her emotionally charged visit to No\u00e9's apartment.\r\nWhen Lionel's former colleague commits suicide on the RER tracks, Lionel has to stop his train when he comes across the body. The father and the daughter then go on a long car trip to visit her mother's tomb in Germany before her wedding.\r\nIn the final scene, Josephine weds a nervous but happy No\u00e9. At the party, Lionel successfully downs 35 shots of rum in celebration of the occasion. It is not clear whether he does so in joy or in sadness. He returns home to live alone.\r\nCast\r\nAlex Descas as Lionel\r\nMati Diop as Josephine\r\nNicole Dogue as Gabrielle\r\nGr\u00e9goire Colin as Noe\r\nProduction\r\nFor the film, director Claire Denis got inspiration from Yasujir\u014d Ozu's film Late Spring, as well as a relationship between her own mother and grandfather. She wrote the screenplay with Jean-Pol Fargeau. The film was shot by Agn\u00e8s Godard. Tindersticks wrote the score for the film.\r\nRelease\r\nThe film had its world premiere out of competition at the 65th Venice International Film Festival on 2 September 2008.
