The film had grossed $46.1 million against a $12 million budget, the two films have grossed over $100 million worldwide.\r\nPlot\r\nTeenager Mia (Sophie N\u00e9lisse) and stepsister Sasha (Corinne Foxx) have just moved to a new school. Another student, Catherine (Brec Bassinger), pushes Mia into the campus pool with Sasha as a bystander. Mia's father Grant (John Corbett) learns about the incident and plans a boat ride for the sisters to see the great white sharks, hoping the two will bond. Grant gives Mia a tooth of a great white shark he found and recounts when Mia used to scuba dive with him.\r\nOn the day of the boat ride, Mia is shocked to see that Catherine and her friends are also there for the tour. Sasha's friends Alexa (Brianne Tju) and Nicole (Sistine Stallone) arrive and tempt them both to go to a secret place with them. The girls get in Alexa's car and have a fun time together at the secret lagoon. Alexa reveals that the lagoon has an entrance to a submerged Mayan city where Grant and his two assistants, Carl (Khylin Rhambo), and Alexa's boyfriend Ben (Davi Santos) are working to prepare for a visit from a group of archaeologists the following week. After finding scuba gear, Nicole persuades the girls to dive through the city, eventually reaching an ancient sacrificial chamber. They encounter a cavefish, and Nicole accidentally knocks over a stone column, causing a chain reaction of collapses.\r\nThe girls become separated by the silt until Mia and Alexa find Ben, who is suddenly devoured by a great white shark and drops the guideline. The girls find each other and are chased by a shark into a tunnel, causing a cave-in to the lagoon's entrance. The girls decide to go back for the guideline but encounter a shark forcing the girls to swim deeper into the city until they reach an air pocket. Mia hears music in the water and leaves the girls behind in an attempt to get help. Elsewhere, Carl, who is listening to the music, is later attacked and killed by a shark. Mia eventually finds his body, and Grant saves her. The two reunite with the other girls, who came looking for her. They realize the shark is blind, having evolved within the caves, and they are able to distract the shark with sounds and make their escape. The group surfaces at a clearing where a pulley system ascender is set in place. However, two sharks come to the surface, and Nicole panics. She attempts to climb up the rope as Alexa is going up, inadvertently causing the rope, and both of them to fall back into the water, where Nicole is eaten by the sharks.\r\nGrant explains that the only way out is to swim back down even deeper in order to find another exit, but is killed by a shark moments later. Mia, Sasha, and Alexa swim into the caves alone, eventually coming upon a strong current that catches Sasha and separates her from the others. Alexa makes it to the other entrance but is attacked by one of the sharks, and Mia is dragged into the current. Alexa escapes by taking off her air tank but gradually drowns. Mia reunites with Sasha at the lower current, and they swim into a newly discovered cave. At the end of the cave, they find a crevice that leads to the surface, but a shark appears and attacks them. Climbing up the narrow crevice, both girls alternatively get caught in the tight space and must abandon their now empty air tanks to escape.\r\nAt the surface, they see a tour boat and start swimming towards it until they realize it is chumming the water to attract sharks. Mia and Sasha get the tourists' attention as they are attacked by the sharks. While Mia makes it onto the boat, Sasha is grabbed by a shark. Mia jumps back into the water and shoots the shark with a flare gun, freeing Sasha. Sasha reaches the boat, but Mia is grabbed into the water by another shark. She escapes by stabbing the shark's eye with the tooth given to her by Grant. Mia swims to the boat and reunites with Sasha as a shocked Catherine watches the boat's staff tend to their wounds.\r\nCast\r\nSophie N\u00e9lisse as Mia\r\nCorinne Foxx as Sasha\r\nBrianne Tju as Alexa\r\nSistine Stallone as Nicole\r\nDavi Santos as Ben\r\nKhylin Rhambo as Carl\r\nBrec Bassinger as Catherine\r\nJohn Corbett as Grant\r\nNia Long as Jennifer\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nIn September 2017, it was announced that production studio The Fyzz Facility was working on a sequel to 47 Meters Down, titled 48 Meters Down. Johannes Roberts returned as director, and again co-wrote the script with Ernest Riera. James Harris and Mark Lane produced the film, as they did the first, and were joined by Robert Jones.\r\nThe sequel takes place in Mexico, and centers around a group of young women who decide to explore some hidden underwater ruins located off-the-beaten trail. Production was overseen by Altitude Film Sales, and potential buyers were sought in Toronto.\r\nIn August 2018, a teaser trailer for the film was released, with a new official title 47 Meters Down: The Next Chapter, before filming had begun. By December of the same year, the film had been re-titled 47 Meters Down: Uncaged.\r\nTomandandy reteams with director Johannes Roberts to compose the second film of 47 Meters Down Uncaged. Varese Sarabande Records has released the soundtrack.\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography for the film took place in the Dominican Republic, Pinewood Indomina Studios, Dominican Republic, The Underwater Studio in Basildon and Pinewood Studios, UK, from December 2018 to February 2019.\r\nRelease\r\nEntertainment Studios handled distribution for the film, and initially set the release for June 28, 2019. In February 2019, it was announced the release date had been pushed back to August 16, 2019, in order to avoid competition with Annabelle Comes Home.\r\nRelease dates for other countries include August 23 (Indonesia), August 28 (South Korea), August 29 (Portugal, Singapore), August 30 (India), September 26 (Chile, Peru), October 10 (Germany) and November 20 (Brazil).

            "html": "<h2>47 Meters Down: Uncaged</h2><p>47 Meters Down: Uncaged is a 2019 American-British survival horror film directed by Johannes Roberts and written by Roberts and Ernest Riera, and a stand alone sequel to 47 Meters Down (2017).</p><p>None of the cast from the previous film returns here. The new cast consists of Sophie N\u00e9lisse, Corinne Foxx, Brianne Tju, Sistine Stallone, Davi Santos, Khylin Rhambo, Brec Bassinger, Nia Long and John Corbett. The plot follows a group of girls who scuba dive to a sunken Mayan city, only to be trapped by a group of sharks that are swimming in it.</p><p>47 Meters Down: Uncaged was released in the United States on August 16, by Entertainment Studios. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its acting and suspense, but criticism for its weaker CGI and lack of scares. The film had grossed $46.1 million against a $12 million budget, the two films have grossed over $100 million worldwide.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>Teenager Mia (Sophie N\u00e9lisse) and stepsister Sasha (Corinne Foxx) have just moved to a new school. Another student, Catherine (Brec Bassinger), pushes Mia into the campus pool with Sasha as a bystander. Mia's father Grant (John Corbett) learns about the incident and plans a boat ride for the sisters to see the great white sharks, hoping the two will bond. Grant gives Mia a tooth of a great white shark he found and recounts when Mia used to scuba dive with him.</p><p>On the day of the boat ride, Mia is shocked to see that Catherine and her friends are also there for the tour. Sasha's friends Alexa (Brianne Tju) and Nicole (Sistine Stallone) arrive and tempt them both to go to a secret place with them. The girls get in Alexa's car and have a fun time together at the secret lagoon. Alexa reveals that the lagoon has an entrance to a submerged Mayan city where Grant and his two assistants, Carl (Khylin Rhambo), and Alexa's boyfriend Ben (Davi Santos) are working to prepare for a visit from a group of archaeologists the following week. After finding scuba gear, Nicole persuades the girls to dive through the city, eventually reaching an ancient sacrificial chamber. They encounter a cavefish, and Nicole accidentally knocks over a stone column, causing a chain reaction of collapses.</p><p>The girls become separated by the silt until Mia and Alexa find Ben, who is suddenly devoured by a great white shark and drops the guideline. The girls find each other and are chased by a shark into a tunnel, causing a cave-in to the lagoon's entrance. The girls decide to go back for the guideline but encounter a shark forcing the girls to swim deeper into the city until they reach an air pocket. Mia hears music in the water and leaves the girls behind in an attempt to get help. Elsewhere, Carl, who is listening to the music, is later attacked and killed by a shark. Mia eventually finds his body, and Grant saves her. The two reunite with the other girls, who came looking for her. They realize the shark is blind, having evolved within the caves, and they are able to distract the shark with sounds and make their escape. The group surfaces at a clearing where a pulley system ascender is set in place. However, two sharks come to the surface, and Nicole panics. She attempts to climb up the rope as Alexa is going up, inadvertently causing the rope, and both of them to fall back into the water, where Nicole is eaten by the sharks.</p><p>Grant explains that the only way out is to swim back down even deeper in order to find another exit, but is killed by a shark moments later. Mia, Sasha, and Alexa swim into the caves alone, eventually coming upon a strong current that catches Sasha and separates her from the others. Alexa makes it to the other entrance but is attacked by one of the sharks, and Mia is dragged into the current. Alexa escapes by taking off her air tank but gradually drowns. Mia reunites with Sasha at the lower current, and they swim into a newly discovered cave. At the end of the cave, they find a crevice that leads to the surface, but a shark appears and attacks them. Climbing up the narrow crevice, both girls alternatively get caught in the tight space and must abandon their now empty air tanks to escape.</p><p>At the surface, they see a tour boat and start swimming towards it until they realize it is chumming the water to attract sharks. Mia and Sasha get the tourists' attention as they are attacked by the sharks. While Mia makes it onto the boat, Sasha is grabbed by a shark. Mia jumps back into the water and shoots the shark with a flare gun, freeing Sasha. Sasha reaches the boat, but Mia is grabbed into the water by another shark. She escapes by stabbing the shark's eye with the tooth given to her by Grant. Mia swims to the boat and reunites with Sasha as a shocked Catherine watches the boat's staff tend to their wounds.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Sophie N\u00e9lisse as Mia</li><li>Corinne Foxx as Sasha</li><li>Brianne Tju as Alexa</li><li>Sistine Stallone as Nicole</li><li>Davi Santos as Ben</li><li>Khylin Rhambo as Carl</li><li>Brec Bassinger as Catherine</li><li>John Corbett as Grant</li><li>Nia Long as Jennifer</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Development</h4><p>In September 2017, it was announced that production studio The Fyzz Facility was working on a sequel to 47 Meters Down, titled 48 Meters Down.
