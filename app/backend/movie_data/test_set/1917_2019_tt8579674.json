The film was also chosen by both the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute as one of the top ten films of 2019.\r\nPlot\r\nOn 6 April 1917, aerial reconnaissance has observed that the German army, which has pulled back from a sector of the Western Front in northern France, is not in retreat but has made a strategic withdrawal to the new Hindenburg Line, where they are waiting to overwhelm the British with artillery. In the British trenches, with field telephone lines cut, two young British Lance Corporals, William Schofield, a veteran of the Somme, and Tom Blake, are ordered by General Erinmore to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment, calling off a scheduled attack the next morning that would jeopardise the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's brother Lieutenant Joseph.\r\nSchofield and Blake cross no man's land to reach the abandoned German trenches. In an underground barracks, they discover a tripwire set by the Germans, which is promptly triggered by a rat; the explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where a German plane is shot down in a dogfight with Allied aircraft. Schofield and Blake save the burned pilot, but the pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield. Schofield comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Taking Blake's rings and dog tag, as well as Erinmore's letter, he is picked up by a passing British unit.\r\nA destroyed canal bridge near \u00c9coust-Saint-Mein prevents the British lorries from crossing, and Schofield chooses to part with them. He uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone, and comes under fire from a sniper. Exchanging shots, Schofield wounds the sniper and advances, whereupon he and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously; the sniper is killed, while Schofield is knocked out. He regains consciousness at night, and finds the town in flames. He discovers a French woman hiding with an infant. She treats his wounds, and he gives her his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite her pleas, Schofield leaves, after hearing the chimes of a nearby clock and realising that time is running out. Pursued by German soldiers after strangling one to death, he escapes by jumping into a river. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank. In the forest, he finds D Company of the 2nd Devons, which is in the last wave of the attack. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie.\r\nRealising that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield sprints across the open battlefield, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way in to meet Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Schofield then finds Joseph, who was among the first wave but is unharmed. Schofield tells Joseph of his mission and that his brother Tom is dead, passing on Tom's rings and dog tag. Joseph is deeply upset about his brother but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to their mother about Tom's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Exhausted, Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and children.\r\nCast\r\nGeorge MacKay as Lance Corporal William \"Will\" Schofield\r\nDean-Charles Chapman as Lance Corporal Thomas \"Tom\" Blake\r\nMark Strong as Captain Smith\r\nAndrew Scott as Lieutenant Leslie\r\nRichard Madden as Lieutenant Joseph Blake\r\nClaire Duburcq as Lauri\r\nColin Firth as General Erinmore\r\nBenedict Cumberbatch as Colonel Mackenzie\r\nDaniel Mays as Sergeant Sanders\r\nAdrian Scarborough as Major Hepburn\r\nJamie Parker as Lieutenant Richards\r\nMichael Jibson as Lieutenant Hutton\r\nRichard McCabe as Colonel Collins\r\nChris Walley as Private Bullen\r\nNabhaan Rizwan as Sepoy Jondalar\r\nMichael Cornelius as Private Cornelius\r\nAnson Boon as Private Cook\r\nProduction\r\nPre-production\r\nAmblin Partners and New Republic Pictures were announced to have acquired the project in June 2018, with Sam Mendes directing, and co-writing the screenplay alongside Krysty Wilson-Cairns. Tom Holland was reported to be in talks for the film in September 2018, though ultimately was not involved, and in October, Roger Deakins was set to reunite with Mendes as cinematographer. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman entered negotiations to star the same month. Thomas Newman was hired to compose the score in March 2019. The same month, Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Richard Madden, Andrew Scott, Daniel Mays, Adrian Scarborough, Jamie Parker, Nabhaan Rizwan, and Claire Duburcq joined the cast in supporting roles.\r\nWriting\r\nIn August 2019, Mendes stated, \"It's the story of a messenger who has a message to carry. And that's all I can say. It lodged with me as a child, this story or this fragment and obviously I've enlarged it significantly. But it has that at its core.\" In Time in 2020, Mendes stated that the writing involved some risk-taking: \"I took a calculated gamble, and I'm pleased I did because of the energy you get just from driving forward (in the narrative), in a war that was fundamentally about paralysis and stasis.\" The ideas for a script, which Mendes wrote with Krysty Wilson-Cairns, came from the story that Mendes's grandfather, Alfred Mendes, a native of Trinidad who was a messenger for the British on the Western Front, had told him. Mendes stated: \"I felt an obligation to honour my grandfather. It's important to remember they were fighting for a free and unified Europe. Good to be reminded of that now.\"\r\nFilming\r\nRoger Deakins was the cinematographer for the film, reuniting with Mendes for their fourth collaboration, having first worked together on Jarhead in 2005. Filming was accomplished with long takes and elaborately choreographed moving camera shots to give the effect of two continuous takes. Although media accounts often refer to the story as being told in only one shot, the story cuts to black one hour and six minutes into the film, when Schofield is knocked unconscious, and fades in upon his regaining consciousness after night has fallen. Mendes explained, \"it was to do with the fact that I wanted the movie to go from afternoon to dusk, and then from night into dawn. I wanted it to be in two movements...I wanted to take it somewhere more like a hallucination. Somewhere more surreal, almost dream-like. And horrifying too\".\r\n1917 was the first film to be shot with the Arri Alexa Mini LF digital cinema camera. Deakins wanted to use a camera with a large format image sensor, but thought that the original Alexa LF was too large and heavy to capture the intimate shots he wanted. Arri provided him with a prototype of the Mini LF two months before filming was set to begin, and two more cameras a week before. His lenses were Arri Signature Primes, of which he used three focal lengths: a 40 mm lens for most of the film, a wider 35 mm for scenes in the tunnels and bunkers, to emphasise feelings of claustrophobia, and a narrower 47 mm in the river, to lose some of the background.\r\nFilming began on 1 April 2019 and continued through June 2019 in Wiltshire, Hankley Common in Surrey and Govan, as well as at Shepperton Studios. Concern was raised about filming on Salisbury Plain by conservationists who felt the production could disturb potentially undiscovered remains, requesting a survey before any set construction began. Some shots required the use of as many as 500 background extras.\r\nSections of the film were also shot near Low Force, on the River Tees, Teesdale in June 2019. The production staff had to install signs warning walkers in the area not to be alarmed at the artificial bodies and body parts strewn around the site. The scenes on the river were mostly shot with a drone and the cast and crew were assisted by a local outdoor adventure provider for safety and stunts.\r\nMusic\r\nThe score was composed by Thomas Newman.\r\nRelease\r\nThe film premiered on 4 December 2019 at the 2019 Royal Film Performance. The film began a limited release in the United States and Canada on 25 December 2019 in eleven venues, before going wide on 10 January 2020.\r\nThe studio spent an estimated $115 million on prints and advertisements promoting the film.\r\nHome media\r\n1917 was released on Digital HD on 10 March 2020 and was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on 24 March 2020.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\n1917 grossed $159.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $215.5 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $374.7 million, against a production budget of $90\u2013100 million. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $77 million.\r\nIn the U.S., the film made $251,000 from 11 venues on its first day of limited release. It went on to have a limited opening weekend of $570,000, and a five-day gross of $1 million, for an average of $91,636 per-venue. The film would go on to make a total of $2.7 million over its 15 days of limited release. It then expanded wide on 10 January, making $14 million on its first day, including $3.25 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to gross $36.5 million for the weekend (beating the original projections of $25 million), becoming the first film to dethrone Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker at the box office. In its second weekend of wide release the film made $22 million (and $26.8 million over the four-day Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday), finishing second behind newcomer Bad Boys for Life. It then made $15.8 million and $7.7 million the following two weekends, remaining in second both times. During the weekend of the Academy Awards, the film made $9.2 million, and it then made $8.1 million in the weekend after its three wins.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 426 reviews, with an average rating of 8.37/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Hard-hitting, immersive, and an impressive technical achievement, 1917 captures the trench warfare of World War I with raw, startling immediacy.\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported it received an average 4.5 out of 5 from viewers they surveyed, with 69% saying they would definitely recommend it.\r\nSeveral critics named the film among the best of 2019, including Kate Erbland of IndieWire and Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter. Karl Vick, writing for Time magazine, found the film to stand up favourably when compared to Stanley Kubrick's WWI film Paths of Glory, stating, \"motion pictures do require a certain amount of motion, and the major accomplishment of 1917, the latest film to join the canon, may be that its makers figured out what the generals could not: a way to advance.\" Rubin Safaya of AwardsWatch.com described the movie as \"a visceral experience and visual masterclass\". Writing for the Hindustan Times, Rohan Naahar stated, \"I can only imagine the effect 1917 will have on audiences that aren't familiar with the techniques Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins are about to unleash upon them.\"\r\nIn his review for NPR, Justin Chang was less positive. He agreed the film was a \"mind-boggling technical achievement\" but did not think it was that spectacular overall, as Mendes's style with its impression of a continuous take \"can be as distracting as it is immersive\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film, \"A carefully organized and sanitized war picture... that turns one of the most catastrophic episodes in modern times into an exercise in preening showmanship.\" Alison Willmore of Vulture compared it unfavourably to the war film Dunkirk (2017), writing, \"The artifice of the aesthetic premise overwhelms any of the film's other intentions.\"\r\nTop ten lists\r\n1917 appeared on many critics' year-end top-ten lists:\r\n1st \u2013 Sam Allard, Cleveland Scene\r\n1st \u2013 Johnny Oleksinski, New York Post\r\n1st \u2013 Tim Miller, Cape Cod Times\r\n1st \u2013 Lawrence Toppman, The Charlotte Observer\r\n1st \u2013 Mal Vincent, The Virginian-Pilot\r\n1st \u2013 Sandy Kenyon, WABC-TV\r\n2nd \u2013 Randy Myers, The Mercury News\r\n3rd \u2013 Matt Goldberg, Collider\r\n3rd \u2013 Jason Rantz, KTTH\r\n3rd \u2013 Mara Reinstein, Us Weekly\r\n3rd \u2013 Chuck Yarborough, Cleveland Plain Dealer\r\n4th \u2013 Lindsey Bahr, Associated Press\r\n4th \u2013 Benjamin Lee, The Guardian\r\n4th \u2013 Brian Truitt, USA Today\r\n5th \u2013 Staff consensus, Consequence of Sound\r\n5th \u2013 Bruce Miller, Sioux City Journal\r\n6th \u2013 Cary Darling, Houston Chronicle\r\n6th \u2013 Peter Travers, Rolling Stone\r\n6th \u2013 Ethan Alter, Marcus Errico and Kevin Polowy, Yahoo!

It received three nominations at the 77th Golden Globe Awards and won two awards: for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and Best Director. It also received eight nominations at the 25th Critics' Choice Awards, winning three awards, including Best Director, and nine nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards, winning the most awards \u2013 seven, including Best Film, Best Director and Outstanding British film. It was chosen by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute as one of the top ten films of the year. On the 23rd of Feberuary 2020, 1917 won the Cinema for Peace Award for the Most Valuable Film of the Year.\r\nHistorical accuracy\r\nThe film was inspired by Operation Alberich, a German withdrawal to new positions on the shorter and more easily defended Hindenburg Line that took place between 9 February and 20 March 1917. However, the main and supporting characters all appear to be fictional.\r\nWriting in the New York Times, Cathy Tempelsman argues that the storyline offers a \"dangerously misleading\" picture of the war, suggesting \"a concern for the sanctity of human life from the top down\", whereas the reality was \"an appalling indifference as the British high command sent hundreds of thousands of their young men to die\". She adds that the \"false heroics and filmmaking feats of wonder\" serve to provide an \"escape from the true carnage of the 'Great War'\", and that in reality the scale of the casualties was such that the potential loss of 1,600 men would not have excited the response portrayed in the film.\r\nThe military historian Jeremy Banning wrote, \"It made no sense, as the film depicts, to have some battalions nine miles beyond the former German line and others seemingly unaware of whether this line was manned... As for the assault by the Devons, no unit would attack without adequate artillery support\".",

Exhausted, Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and children.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>George MacKay as Lance Corporal William \"Will\" Schofield</li><li>Dean-Charles Chapman as Lance Corporal Thomas \"Tom\" Blake</li><li>Mark Strong as Captain Smith</li><li>Andrew Scott as Lieutenant Leslie</li><li>Richard Madden as Lieutenant Joseph Blake</li><li>Claire Duburcq as Lauri</li><li>Colin Firth as General Erinmore</li><li>Benedict Cumberbatch as Colonel Mackenzie</li><li>Daniel Mays as Sergeant Sanders</li><li>Adrian Scarborough as Major Hepburn</li><li>Jamie Parker as Lieutenant Richards</li><li>Michael Jibson as Lieutenant Hutton</li><li>Richard McCabe as Colonel Collins</li><li>Chris Walley as Private Bullen</li><li>Nabhaan Rizwan as Sepoy Jondalar</li><li>Michael Cornelius as Private Cornelius</li><li>Anson Boon as Private Cook</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Pre-production</h4><p>Amblin Partners and New Republic Pictures were announced to have acquired the project in June 2018, with Sam Mendes directing, and co-writing the screenplay alongside Krysty Wilson-Cairns. Tom Holland was reported to be in talks for the film in September 2018, though ultimately was not involved, and in October, Roger Deakins was set to reunite with Mendes as cinematographer. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman entered negotiations to star the same month. Thomas Newman was hired to compose the score in March 2019. The same month, Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Richard Madden, Andrew Scott, Daniel Mays, Adrian Scarborough, Jamie Parker, Nabhaan Rizwan, and Claire Duburcq joined the cast in supporting roles.</p><h4>Writing</h4><p>In August 2019, Mendes stated, \"It's the story of a messenger who has a message to carry. And that's all I can say. It lodged with me as a child, this story or this fragment and obviously I've enlarged it significantly. But it has that at its core.\" In Time in 2020, Mendes stated that the writing involved some risk-taking: \"I took a calculated gamble, and I'm pleased I did because of the energy you get just from driving forward (in the narrative), in a war that was fundamentally about paralysis and stasis.\" The ideas for a script, which Mendes wrote with Krysty Wilson-Cairns, came from the story that Mendes's grandfather, Alfred Mendes, a native of Trinidad who was a messenger for the British on the Western Front, had told him. Mendes stated: \"I felt an obligation to honour my grandfather. It's important to remember they were fighting for a free and unified Europe. Good to be reminded of that now.\"</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Roger Deakins was the cinematographer for the film, reuniting with Mendes for their fourth collaboration, having first worked together on Jarhead in 2005. Filming was accomplished with long takes and elaborately choreographed moving camera shots to give the effect of two continuous takes. Although media accounts often refer to the story as being told in only one shot, the story cuts to black one hour and six minutes into the film, when Schofield is knocked unconscious, and fades in upon his regaining consciousness after night has fallen. Mendes explained, \"it was to do with the fact that I wanted the movie to go from afternoon to dusk, and then from night into dawn. I wanted it to be in two movements...I wanted to take it somewhere more like a hallucination. Somewhere more surreal, almost dream-like. And horrifying too\".</p><p>1917 was the first film to be shot with the Arri Alexa Mini LF digital cinema camera. Deakins wanted to use a camera with a large format image sensor, but thought that the original Alexa LF was too large and heavy to capture the intimate shots he wanted. Arri provided him with a prototype of the Mini LF two months before filming was set to begin, and two more cameras a week before. His lenses were Arri Signature Primes, of which he used three focal lengths: a 40 mm lens for most of the film, a wider 35 mm for scenes in the tunnels and bunkers, to emphasise feelings of claustrophobia, and a narrower 47 mm in the river, to lose some of the background.</p><p>Filming began on 1 April 2019 and continued through June 2019 in Wiltshire, Hankley Common in Surrey and Govan, as well as at Shepperton Studios. Concern was raised about filming on Salisbury Plain by conservationists who felt the production could disturb potentially undiscovered remains, requesting a survey before any set construction began. Some shots required the use of as many as 500 background extras.</p><p>Sections of the film were also shot near Low Force, on the River Tees, Teesdale in June 2019. The production staff had to install signs warning walkers in the area not to be alarmed at the artificial bodies and body parts strewn around the site. The scenes on the river were mostly shot with a drone and the cast and crew were assisted by a local outdoor adventure provider for safety and stunts.</p><br/><h3>Music</h3><p>The score was composed by Thomas Newman.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><p>The film premiered on 4 December 2019 at the 2019 Royal Film Performance. The film began a limited release in the United States and Canada on 25 December 2019 in eleven venues, before going wide on 10 January 2020.</p><p>The studio spent an estimated $115 million on prints and advertisements promoting the film.</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>1917 was released on Digital HD on 10 March 2020 and was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on 24 March 2020.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Box office</h4><p>1917 grossed $159.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $215.5 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $374.7 million, against a production budget of $90\u2013100 million. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $77 million.</p><p>In the U.S., the film made $251,000 from 11 venues on its first day of limited release. It went on to have a limited opening weekend of $570,000, and a five-day gross of $1 million, for an average of $91,636 per-venue. The film would go on to make a total of $2.7 million over its 15 days of limited release. It then expanded wide on 10 January, making $14 million on its first day, including $3.25 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to gross $36.5 million for the weekend (beating the original projections of $25 million), becoming the first film to dethrone Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker at the box office. In its second weekend of wide release the film made $22 million (and $26.8 million over the four-day Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday), finishing second behind newcomer Bad Boys for Life. It then made $15.8 million and $7.7 million the following two weekends, remaining in second both times. During the weekend of the Academy Awards, the film made $9.2 million, and it then made $8.1 million in the weekend after its three wins.</p><h4>Critical response</h4><p>On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 426 reviews, with an average rating of 8.37/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Hard-hitting, immersive, and an impressive technical achievement, 1917 captures the trench warfare of World War I with raw, startling immediacy.\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported it received an average 4.5 out of 5 from viewers they surveyed, with 69% saying they would definitely recommend it.</p><p>Several critics named the film among the best of 2019, including Kate Erbland of IndieWire and Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter. Karl Vick, writing for Time magazine, found the film to stand up favourably when compared to Stanley Kubrick's WWI film Paths of Glory, stating, \"motion pictures do require a certain amount of motion, and the major accomplishment of 1917, the latest film to join the canon, may be that its makers figured out what the generals could not: a way to advance.\" Rubin Safaya of AwardsWatch.com described the movie as \"a visceral experience and visual masterclass\". Writing for the Hindustan Times, Rohan Naahar stated, \"I can only imagine the effect 1917 will have on audiences that aren't familiar with the techniques Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins are about to unleash upon them.\"</p><p>In his review for NPR, Justin Chang was less positive. He agreed the film was a \"mind-boggling technical achievement\" but did not think it was that spectacular overall, as Mendes's style with its impression of a continuous take \"can be as distracting as it is immersive\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film, \"A carefully organized and sanitized war picture... that turns one of the most catastrophic episodes in modern times into an exercise in preening showmanship.\" Alison Willmore of Vulture compared it unfavourably to the war film Dunkirk (2017), writing, \"The artifice of the aesthetic premise overwhelms any of the film's other intentions.\"</p><h4>Top ten lists</h4><p>1917 appeared on many critics' year-end top-ten lists:</p><ul><li>1st \u2013 Sam Allard, Cleveland Scene</li><li>1st \u2013 Johnny Oleksinski, New York Post</li><li>1st \u2013 Tim Miller, Cape Cod Times</li><li>1st \u2013 Lawrence Toppman, The Charlotte Observer</li><li>1st \u2013 Mal Vincent, The Virginian-Pilot</li><li>1st \u2013 Sandy Kenyon, WABC-TV</li><li>2nd \u2013 Randy Myers, The Mercury News</li><li>3rd \u2013 Matt Goldberg, Collider</li><li>3rd \u2013 Jason Rantz, KTTH</li><li>3rd \u2013 Mara Reinstein, Us Weekly</li><li>3rd \u2013 Chuck Yarborough, Cleveland Plain Dealer</li><li>4th \u2013 Lindsey Bahr, Associated Press</li><li>4th \u2013 Benjamin Lee, The Guardian</li><li>4th \u2013 Brian Truitt, USA Today</li><li>5th \u2013 Staff consensus, Consequence of Sound</li><li>5th \u2013 Bruce Miller, Sioux City Journal</li><li>6th \u2013 Cary Darling, Houston Chronicle</li><li>6th \u2013 Peter Travers, Rolling Stone</li><li>6th \u2013 Ethan Alter, Marcus Errico and Kevin Polowy, Yahoo!

It received three nominations at the 77th Golden Globe Awards and won two awards: for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and Best Director. It also received eight nominations at the 25th Critics' Choice Awards, winning three awards, including Best Director, and nine nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards, winning the most awards \u2013 seven, including Best Film, Best Director and Outstanding British film. It was chosen by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute as one of the top ten films of the year. On the 23rd of Feberuary 2020, 1917 won the Cinema for Peace Award for the Most Valuable Film of the Year.</p><br/><h3>Historical accuracy</h3><p>The film was inspired by Operation Alberich, a German withdrawal to new positions on the shorter and more easily defended Hindenburg Line that took place between 9 February and 20 March 1917. However, the main and supporting characters all appear to be fictional.</p><p>Writing in the New York Times, Cathy Tempelsman argues that the storyline offers a \"dangerously misleading\" picture of the war, suggesting \"a concern for the sanctity of human life from the top down\", whereas the reality was \"an appalling indifference as the British high command sent hundreds of thousands of their young men to die\". She adds that the \"false heroics and filmmaking feats of wonder\" serve to provide an \"escape from the true carnage of the 'Great War'\", and that in reality the scale of the casualties was such that the potential loss of 1,600 men would not have excited the response portrayed in the film.</p><p>The military historian Jeremy Banning wrote, \"It made no sense, as the film depicts, to have some battalions nine miles beyond the former German line and others seemingly unaware of whether this line was manned... As for the assault by the Devons, no unit would attack without adequate artillery support\".</p><br/>"
